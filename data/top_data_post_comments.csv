wfgn7j,iitroto,70,Just stopping by to say congrats!
wfgn7j,iiu9fzx,44,Hey if you can show a link to your projects and resume that’ll be great
wfgn7j,iiu8lag,45,"Well you can't leave us hanging, please do share your resume with us but make sure to blur your personal info, and congrats."
wfgn7j,iitvtkc,12,Congrats! That’s so cool! What kind of projects did you do to help prepare?
wfgn7j,iiu9b9f,10,"Congratulations!!! 

This post just came the day I gave up. But wont be changing the fact that I wont be the one anytime soon:("
wfgn7j,iiumt7e,9,"I’ve used a Google extension that sees how your resume matches the position.  

There’s ATS (Applicant Tracking Software) that filters resumes; so if your resume doesn’t have enough key words, it doesn’t pass the ATS and automatically denied."
wfgn7j,iiujvye,10,"How many of your six interviews had a ""skills"" or logic test?"
wfgn7j,iitvtqf,6,Congratulations man. Cam you share how many projects did you do? And how many months it took from zero till you got the job?
wfgn7j,iitu9it,6,How did you approach self projects? Any specific websites or skills you displayed?
wfgn7j,iitu9l5,14,"Wow congratulations!! I'm happy for you, you deserve it and it will only get better from here! I have an interview tomorrow for an entry level data analyst position that involves data annotation and essentially rating user results based on Bing.com searches and the UHRS platform. Could you be so kind to help me with the following question in case they ask (recruiter suggested it): do an example exercise of a typical on-the-job task. Basically to measure how I would handle a query. I understand if you don't want to help me, I'm asking just in case. Thank you in advance!"
10onhl2,j6fugrb,31,"Great post. Upvoted. Maybe u/MurphysLab, u/Sir_QuacksALot, u/Wheres_my_warg or u/Analbidness can sticky.

Another thing that helps in other subs is having a weekly stickied ""entering/transitioning"" thread where people can ask these questions, and automatically locking/removing any topics outside of that.

Then if the mods stop all the link farming, the sub will be great. :)"
10onhl2,j6g9802,18,Yeah I’ve found Alex the Analyst great for getting going with this sort of stuff. I quite like Luke Barousse too but find Alex’s content focuses a bit more on “I’m just looking at data analysis and have no idea where to start”
10onhl2,j6houdm,18,"Concerning Excel I will personally add the Youtube Channel ""Excel is fun"". Tons of videos, two playlists dedicated to learning data analysis in Excel and Many exercices with answers. Best content I found for this"
10onhl2,j6h66m0,9,this is actually the most helpful post i’ve ever seen in this sub so far.
10onhl2,j6jnm7v,9,"Stickying this, it’ll be up till we can make a wiki. Once we can get a list of rules together, we can start having auto mod remove the repetitive questions.

On a personal note, I agree with everything, but i’d recommend to start applying for jobs early. You don’t need to wait until you’ve mastered Excel/sql/tableau/Python/R, once you have a couple projects under your belt I’d start applying. If I would’ve waited until I mastered Python and R before applying to jobs, I would’ve missed out on 3 years of work experience."
10onhl2,j6k17f3,6,This is the joint most helpful post I’ve ever seen about becoming a data analyst. 10/10.
10onhl2,j6fr6dl,6,Good effort
10onhl2,j6gobd5,5,This should be sticked
10onhl2,j6nuhgd,6,"Coursera is a good learning website for data analysis too. I know it was mentioned in relation to the google cert, but probably worth linking under Learning Websites."
10onhl2,j6gut6c,3,Alex is fantastic. He’s where I got my start too
unoys0,ie8nr5e,72,"**FOR ALL THOSE STILL WAITING:**

Take this with a **heavy** grain of salt, but I have a SWE friend in Google that is close to (but does not work directly with) recruiting. She said that apprenticeships @ Google in the grand scheme of things are a very new process, and every year they get more and more people and need to take more and more time to streamline new problems that come up.

She also said that the estimated 4-6 weeks hearback time is usually a very conservative estimate, and people can get notified as late as Aug. Every team could do their applications differently (eg. some might do a round 1 reach out, then round 2 reach out vs. others just does a blanket read), but they definitely look through all applications. Sending your application early vs. late does not give you a distinct advantage.

Regarding locations, they staff based on openings. If NYC has 10 positions for SWE, then that SWE application team will look for people who have NYC in the preference and then consider those people specifically. There's a big process about evaluating based on people's location preferences, but they try their best to match the candidate to the location and the candidate's preference. She did not elaborate more on this, but assured that everyone's location preference is considered fairly. 

\--

TDLR: **It ain't over until it's over! If you haven't been rejected, you're still being considered!**

Regardless of outcome, we should all continue pushing our passions in this great field! Look at this ""delayed"" waiting period as bonus time for prepping interview material. :) Best of luck to everyone's journies!"
unoys0,id7y5zi,60,"Hey guys, just wanted to help share the good news and curious if anyone else has gotten more information:

I just received an email for the IT apprenticeship that I applied for in Austin (I posted more information on another comment in this thread) that I got selected for the interview process! It was a long email stating multiple things what to expect, two 45 minute interviews to be done virtually on the same day, with an option of up to 4 dates that I could schedule the interview. The recruiter also wants to schedule a phone interview to “discuss the interview process and how to best prepare for the interviews”. There were also a lot of other things to look out for, tips for the interview, etc. 

It didn’t state the salary, nor the location for verification purposes, but I’ll ask the recruiter for more details. Start date would be September 12th, 2022, and would be a 12 month commitment as per the email. I wish everyone the best, and to comment below if anyone has anymore questions!"
unoys0,idne6ia,49,"Hey guys, here with another update!! I spoke to the recruiter, and she gave me some juicy details that we all have been curious about! (Keep in mind this is for IT in Austin, TX, so your mileage may vary)

So for IT the pay was stated to be $23.56/hr (paid hourly). Candidates would receive a $7000 stipend should you need to relocate to the Austin location, plus gas/flight tickets if need be. Doing the math as follows (($23.56/hr) * (8hr/1day))= $188.48/day (($188.48/day) * (5day/week)) = $942.4/week
(($942.4/week * 52weeks/1 year)) = $49,004.8/year, aka the salary. So adding the relocation stipend of $7000 you get $56,004.8 for the 12 month commitment. 

Although the start date is officially September 12, 2022, there will be 3 weeks of virtual onboarding, followed by a 6 week “bootcamp” to teach more fundamentals about IT. So the actual start date to PHYSICALLY be there would be November 14, 2022 as per the recruiter.

The work life would be Monday - Friday, hybrid style of 3 days in the office, 2 days remote. Should you wish to come to the office 5 days a week, you may, but 3 days minimum to come in. Flexibility is available depending on whichever team you join.

For the two interviews that will be conducted, one of the interviewers will become your manager, as per the recruiter. The interviews are back to back. 

Benefits such as healthcare, dental, vision, 401k etc. Not to be disclosed until an offer is extended.

I know that was A LOT, but hopefully that helps clarify some uncertainty that many of us had. If y’all have anymore information, please feel free to comment below so that everyone’s questions can be asked, or DM me if you feel more comfortable with that. Good luck to everyone applying!!"
unoys0,ijrztfw,46,I just received an offer for DA.
unoys0,idyjyvz,43,"8MINS AGO 

I was sent an interview for the UX Design program I am extremely excited!!! WOOO!!!

It was the standard email explaining the program and different aspects the start date, how to interview etc

The interviews selection was from July 7th to July 14th!! Says the UX program will be fully remote and that the program will start OCTOBER 18th, 2022

I’m so excited good luck to everyone!!!"
unoys0,ik0flgs,44,I GOT GOOGLE REMOTE FOR SWE!!!!!
unoys0,id7vcbf,30,"Hey everyone! Just a couple of quick notes.  


**First**: For people wondering how to get on the list we’ve compiled so far- either post a comment with your application date, track and city or DM me that info and I’ll add it to the list.    [https://googlelist.netlify.app/](https://googlelist.netlify.app/)  


&#x200B;

**Second**: I felt a couple of people were almost apologetic in their DMs for bothering. Please know that you are doing me and everyone that refers to that list a favor by providing your data. I’m extremely grateful and more than happy to add your info to the list; which by the way only takes a few seconds anyway. So it’s not a bother at all.  


&#x200B;

Wishing everyone good luck this week! Please continue to update us here, if you can, as you receive responses from Google.  


I know that losing an opportunity to apprentice at the happiest place on earth (and don’t tell me it’s Disney! lol) may be difficult to digest but in the event that we do receive bad news, let’s look forward to learning, building etc. and being ready for that next great opportunity. I love how supportive and encouraging this group has been!"
unoys0,idycjmh,30,"I applied to SWE for both Atlanta & Remote on May 2, got a questionnaire June 10, and invited to interview June 22. My recruiter said all the teams who review applications and schedule interviews are under a heavy load and things are moving really slow due to so many applications to review. If you haven't heard back at all yet, hang in there and don't give up!"
unoys0,idzecn4,33,Update: received an invitation to interview for UX!

z1v48z,ixdji28,66,Sometimes I laugh at the fact that I get paid very nearly 6 figures to occasionally be tasked with exceedingly urgent needs such as “can you change the sort order of this Excel table?”

10eguql,j4w2xbk,2,"Haha, but also, your users are not experts in which data is in nicely modelled, well maintained structures, which are poor quality, which you have the source data but nobody's looked at it, which are totally unstructured and need some serious spelunking.

I’m surprised at how dull it is as I thought it was going to actually be much more in depth. I’m 27, currently a truck driver for FedEx. Being able to actually switch careers to data analytics one day sounds like a complete fantasy unfortunately but seeing posts like this gives me hope!"

q37irg,hfq4k5g,34,I recently completed the full course except the capstone project. I'm a student and I'm totally new in this data analysis field. I never had any professional job. I know that for a newbie this course in not enough. What else should I do to progress in Data Analysis field?
q37irg,hgu6g17,17,"I just finished this certification. I had absolutely no experience or classes before this. I had basic excel (very basic) experience just from working in an office. It took me 9 days. I really enjoyed it! If you have any interest in DA, I encourage you to take it!!"
q37irg,hhixf3r,10,"I will not leave my current job soon, but this course and the one by IBM helped a lot in my workplace, and I didn't even finish them.  
I have a solid background in server administration (Windows, Linux and SQL Server/Oracle/MySQL) and my current job is 99% this, but once in a while we need to bring data to life.  
Before I only used my knowledge in SQL and in Excel and give back to the user, because that wasn´t my main job. Now I´m constantly praised because the value of the information I can provide.  


Can´t go in specifics because I´m work in the military, but one of my data analysis projects coupled with a powerpoint presentation masterpiece worth of being in any museum (Ok maybe I´m a little hyped) later, my boss managed to change the entire course of one of the biggest military operations here in my country."
q37irg,hft54u5,8,"Great review, good write-up. However, it seems to me that this course is mainly intended to help people already in the industry or who have many years of experience in a related industry get a new position. It doesn’t look like it’ll help new grads or anyone trying to get in entry level positions, which is unfortunate. 

But I think I’ll give it a shot, maybe it can beef up the resume a bit"

q37irg,hhhrbx8,4,Thanks so much for this post. I'm half way through the certificate program and looking for some motivation. I hope to apply for some positions as soon as I'm done with these modules. I'm an English teacher and i've been trying to change careers for a while now.
q37irg,hml2xb5,4,Can a person with 0 knowledge or qualifications in data analysis (eg: College degree in an entirely unrelated field) start applying to entry level data analysis positions just by completing this course?
q37irg,hfrvfgf,3,"Great to read this detailed feedback.

How long did it took you to go thru all the course material?"
q37irg,hk0sr8b,3,"I'm about to graduate with Spring with a bachelors in Supply Chain Management (Business)  and i'm 4/8 courses into the Google Data Analytics Certification. I feel hesitant and anxious because as I see job postings on LinkedIn it looks dire as employers seem to really want people with technical degrees in computer science, math, engineering and etc. I'm not sure if I could spin my degree to look technical enough at all.  


I don't know if anyone can help me at all here with some advice. Is the Data Analythics Career locked out for me unless I go back to school somehow and get a technical degree? Should I just pack it all and go somewhere else?  


I can program on Python and I feel comfortable with Excel but I don't know how to truly test that at all.  


I've thought about doing projects but I don't know how far to design them or what to do it in at all. I'm passionate about gaming but I don't think I want to show that to employers and recruiters because they might be afraid i'm not dedicated to being 'serious'."

I plan to begin the certification course this week and will be hiring a company to overhaul my resume and LinkedIn profile, with the goal of beginning to apply for entry level data analysis positions in June (after the school year has ended).

xx8z4a,irdvmzw,6,"This is great to read. One of the most demoralizing parts of job hunting is being ghosted or abruptly dismissed from the running through a dehumanizing ""position closed"" form letter. In the UK it has become quite toxic across all industries. I don't need an ego stroke if I am not the chosen, but how hard is it to send a simple ""thanks for applying but we are going with another candidate""? It's just basic civility. 

End rant. Congrats on your new job! Good luck. :)"

Most overrated piece of shit cert I have done in my life. If you have any basic knowledge of sql or R, it's a waste of time unless you want the cert for your resume or LinkedIn because you are NOT going to learn anything worthwhile your time.

x7de8o,inbrggx,30,Interviewer never showed up? Damn lol
x7de8o,inbs22r,67,"You applied for 579 jobs and only got 11 interviews? That is a 1.89 interview rate.

My god. I applaud you for your tenacity."
x7de8o,inbrg7h,10,Congratulations! What kind of training or experience did you have?
x7de8o,inbuglr,7,"What happened to the other ~~5~~ 4 interviews? It says 11, but then totals out of there are only 7.

On the other end, I was hiring for a position (not DA), but the interviewee didn't show up. It was even a virtual/remote interview after initial screening and got passed on to me as the hiring manager. Odd."
x7de8o,inby3hd,6,"I'm still figuring out analytics. Forgive me, but which software did you use for this visualisation"
x7de8o,inc4dih,5,"Could we have some more data so we can analyze the 579 jobs you applied to (pun(?) intended). Did you write a personalized cv and letter tailored for the position advertised for the 579 job ads or did you simply write one general cv and cover letter that you sent to all the job ads?

Because it’s a big difference between a general cv where the hiring manager can clearly see that you didn’t put any effort in tailoring the cv and letter for the position and a tailored cv where you highlighted your skills in relation to what the position asked for. 

579 jobs applied to is of course a lot regardless but it’s ”a lot less” if you sent the same cv and letter to all the hiring managers vs showing you actually read the job ad."

yrpmjb,ivvnfrc,38,"Unhelpful Advice: Do projects

Helpful Advice: Here’s a project idea and how to get started so that you’re not completely on your own with no idea what to do"
yrpmjb,ivv520o,22,DataCamp has projects to complete as well. Kaggle too!
yrpmjb,ivxb2qf,8,"The project that will get you points in an interview is the on you're passionate about.

If you're really into day trading, do some price analytics or performance tracking or something that is useful to you or a small community that you *like* spending time improving.

If it's games, look at your favourite sports or esports team, or your/your clan's/your friend's competitive performance through whatever API is available, and create some tool you find interesting or valuable.

Maybe these one-off small scope suggested projects work for other people, but I couldn't really muster enthusiasm beyond a couple sessions for them. For my own projects, I can spend six hours tinkering around the edges and wonder where the time went, and I can talk extensively about what I've done, the 'value' I've created (even if super niche and to a very small subset of people) the challenges I've faced and the answers I came up with.

Doing projects to further your skills is awesome. Practical learning is great. A straight-up list of little oneshot projects you've done isn't likely to turn 'no interview' into 'interview'.

Fundamentally, if your technical skills are good enough to answer some questions on SQL/Python/R/PBI/Whatever, you aren't going to be receiving a lot of rejections for *technical* reasons unless those are the roles you are going for - they are going to be frustrating woolly reasons like 'not enough experience' or 'not a culture fit' or 'not enough understanding of corporate culture.'"
yrpmjb,ivv0q0s,16,"I have heard that it is important to do a unique project that shows something about you. I don't know if that's true, but it makes sense. You're not going to stand out if your portfolio looks like everyone else's."
yrpmjb,ivvw0i9,3,Maybe it was a post written by a recruiter so that he can more easily recognize who is a beginner from who is experienced. Smart move!
yrpmjb,ivvc3bd,6,This also has some project ideas: https://datastoryteller.gumroad.com/p/examples-of-data-analytics-projects
yrpmjb,ivvoxm2,2,Appreciate the help!!
yrpmjb,ivz2v6a,2,Thank you!
yrpmjb,iwq1hks,1,Does anyone know of any good guided projects but for data engineering?
10nehyq,j6a2atk,18,Aren’t we all forever at step 3?
10nehyq,j6a3c9o,8,Jokes on you I am dumb
10nehyq,j6f01zd,5,"This is not fully wrong and not fully right.

I did a lot in quick succession, with a lot of stack overflow. I have adhd. If I took my time, and my interest waned, I wouldn’t have entered the field of data analysis at all nor completed my certs. I am a darned good analyst, too - 1.5 years into this I’m the go to guy for my organization when there’s a tough nut to crack and the task variety is magical for my adhd brain.

The real answer is “figure out what works for you. This guy learned by taking his time, that may or may not be you. You’ve got to keep your learning in your head, make it work and get to it.”"
10nehyq,j69fypf,13,"This is why I tell everyone who’s looking to “break into” this field to forget bootcamps. They’re just super over priced BS. Get some books, find some videos on YouTube, a beginner course on Udemy, and start building. It will be a bitch, but it comes together eventually."
10nehyq,j68gnrp,12,The guy has a PhD.
10nehyq,j6cpid3,2,"Looking for some advice and feedback here. If you have a moment, would you please check my [portfolio](https://emptyjar.in) ?  I write articles on personal projects I have done which is basically Step-1 on the OP.  I also maintain my [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/titassaha) where I keep my code.

I just want to know if what I have done are appealing to HRs for data analyst positions. 

Appreciate your time, thank you!"

xaxvwd,inwxg9d,3,"This is awesome! I’m in the midst of transitioning from a 15 year hospitality career in Rooms myself, and for lot of the very same reasons. Love to hear your success story, very motivating :)"
xaxvwd,inxn8sd,3,"Damn this is inspiring considering I’m in the similar position where I work as a bartender/server, this is my first job out of college, did my bachelors in hospitality, but after working in reality I realized I needed to do something different, always had an analytical approach to things and somehow came across data and business analytics, hopefully one day I’ll have a success story as yours, cheers 💯"
xaxvwd,inw9ij5,2,Congrats! Where do you live?
xaxvwd,inwg8y5,2,Nice!! I am loving the Google Cert program.
xaxvwd,inwkv17,2,"Congratulations man. I am also just at the end of Google certification but along with it I am practicing my sql and visualization skills and some python. Now will start mini projects and applications. It feels good to hear such success stories. Keeps me motivated.
Also is it possible to you to share what kind of projects did you work on?"
xaxvwd,inxt6wa,2,This was inspiring.   Congratulations and do good!!
xaxvwd,inwpi5h,4,"Congrats! 

Also we should make this post the auto-reply for all the questions we get from folks asking if you can get a job with the Google cert."
109foxy,j3yd53t,41,"I couldn't agree more. When I was trying to break into the field I was focused on Python since ""more technical = better"" but I'm now 4 years into this ride and have only just started to use it regularly. Excel to Power BI to SQL is the learning path I'd recommend to those trying to break in."
109foxy,j3y8yhs,16,"Thanks for posting this. I thought about an answer similar but I didn't end up writing anything. There are so, so many variations on what a data analyst is and does every day. Personally I'm a crime analyst and I've never used Python professionally, but I have used Power BI and Tableau, SQL, and unfortunately a lot of Excel. SQL is critical to what I do."
109foxy,j3yp2eb,11,"Some ppl trying to break into data analytics don’t know that Excel and Power Query are enough to make you a data analyst and get the job done. 
Of course you still need to learn about data modeling, data viz, statistics and understanding the domain expertise that you’re interested to work in as a data analyst. If you wanna be SCM Data Analyst then you have to understand the ins and outs of supply chain management, at least take basic to intermediate level courses and read books. Same thing for other domains like healthcare, finance.. etc"
109foxy,j40wl8t,9,"The amount of companies that still use excel as main tool would surprise a lot of people in this sub.
Reality is often... disappointing"
109foxy,j3yszdu,7,"I think learning Python makes learning SQL, Excel, Visual tools easier. You’re forced to think abstractly and logically for each action. But I do SQL, Excel and Visual tools are much more heavily used and more important."
109foxy,j40ulks,6,"Just my 2 cents. It depend where do you work. I see that in the US, Excel/SQL/Tableau are the most common programs used to do Data Analysis. And that is all you need (and a good portfolio)....

Here in Portugal, when we look for a Data Analyst job they ask SQL/PowerBi/Python and if you know something about JavaScript, C# (just to name some) are a very big plus.

Here they want that we all know everything and pay just one salary...."
109foxy,j4fn9fy,3,Thanks for this. I am just starting my education in this field. I have a degree in Statistics but I feel that adding analytics skills would be perfect for my career growth.
109foxy,j3yp3px,2,"Curious question. As a BI analyst, why is knowing SQL so important if you know a BI tool? Can’t you do whatever sql-related task in Tableau/Powerbi if you have data already in a database/table? What benefit does knowing SQL truly give in this case?

Fwiw, I’m familiar with python (for etl), mysql( storage), excel , tableau and power bi but I struggle finding any relevant use-case to use sql extensively other than storage"
109foxy,j460bqp,2,Agree. SQL seems to be the key skill and organisations tend to use Power BI instead of Tableau.
109foxy,j3yharb,2,"Starting out...when? Your first job isn't where you started out, it started out in college, and even highschool. 

My advice to my younger self, starting off in highschool (Which applies to everyone): ""You are far to arrogant, and you need to ask advice on those things you are far to arrogant to admit to yourself.""

I grew up working class, and admired my dad and grandfather's for having ""real"" jobs. Mental health was thought of something to overcome rather than treat. I'd love to convince my younger self that I have anxiety and ADHD disrupts your whole life. But being a product of my surroundings, I didn't realize how much I needed help until I went through a particularly tough part of my life. It's a little crazy how I felt at the time, actually. 

So, that, humble yourself enough to realize what you need help with. Oh, that, and VBA is a terrible language to learn programming from."
118vzvb,j9jh547,22,"Congrats! That’s a huge step!

I have to admit I’ve never heard of a data analyst role that requires an entry exam and signing an NDA about the selection process and job details. I’m US based and have only applied to US jobs, so my perspective is admittedly biased.

However, if I’m being completely honest, this sounds like it could be some kind of scam. OP, if they start making you pay them, you need to leave the company. I certainly hope this is legit though!"
118vzvb,j9jokfp,19,Congrats! 59 here and I’m working in my first role too!

nn5yu7,gzt4egb,21,">I found a company I liked and spent two hours on a very tailored cover letter. I don't know how much that improved my chances but I feel it helped. I spent probably 4 hours researching the company and preparing for the interview.

This right here is one of the best ways to prepare for an interview.  Hands down.

So many people overlook this and just apply to 1000 random jobs blindly and complain about their random results.  No answer, or job sucks, or whatever.  

Be deliberate and give it your all.  Job description on one screen, your resume in another screen.  Your resume should mirror the job description as close as possible. 

Research the company.  Learn what their focus is, what projects and milestones are happening.  Make a list of what it's doing that you want to get in on.  If you have questions about what you're reading, ffs ask them at the interview, that's what it's for. 

Don't be a random candidate. 

Good job, your journey was absolutely no accident."

And that is most important in this case I guess. He did mention that the reason he only analyzed the first 3 results were because 50-75% of people only clicked the first 3 results. Though if you hear the whole testimony, it seems that he did investigate those websites further to see what other stories they wrote.

11a2q49,j9phvwl,44,"This is a position I used to have exactly, and the physical requirements are more or less generic stuff they say for everyone.

Really you mostly look into why items are getting deleted/added to inventory when you don’t expect and then ideally using analysis skills to try to reduce the unexpected additions and deletions, basically improving inventory accuracy. Excel is definitely nice, and you can really be extra good at the job/set yourself apart with some SQL knowledge.

Honestly I loved it, its title is a bit misleading if you do the bare minimum but you can definitely find ways to use data analysis skills to stand out, honestly a really good “foot in the door” data analysis position to gain experience

This is not a corporate job but a warehouse job, hence why it has the ""lift up to 49 pounds"" basic qualification. Additionally, this is not an ""L4"" (entry-level corporate) role but a ""Tier 3"" role which is a warehouse level designation. This role is not salaried and pays similar to the other Tier 3 associates in the building. As an ICQA Data Analyst you are responsible for all things analysis for the warehouse this role is hiring for. 

It is an incredible foot-in-the-door role and I've seen a lot of warehouse associates do this for a year or two then move into corporate with all the SQL/AWS experience gained in the role.

This is an excellent role for current warehouse associates/process assistants with Excel experience that already understand how their building processes and moves inventory physically/virtually."

v4ve6y,ib69lgt,31,"This is just one way to do data analysis. I think it starts off very good by asking at a top-down level, ""what is the question to be answered?"". Data mining  takes a different approach by going bottom up and finding out what questions can be answered from the data. A top-down approach is the best way to add value.

I don't think the process is complete though.

Before collecting data, you'll have to collect the requirements of the data that will be needed to answer the question.

 The final step would be to make a decision or gain some knowledge that you did not know before... And hopefully answer the question. But if it does not answer the question, then the process would start over at collecting more data or doing a different analysis. Also, there are some questions that cannot be answered or it would be expensive to collect and compute the data to answer the question.

Also, step four is kind of mysterious,  ""analyze the data"". There are a lot of different methods to analyze data. Sometimes you're going to have to go back to step one, two, and three depending on the requirements and ouput of the algorithm or model. 

So, no, it is not likely to be this straightforward."
v4ve6y,ib6h8qi,18,"Depending on your data Step 3 (cleaning the data) can take a ton of time. Like 80% of your time!

Also, it's good to visualize your data earlier in the process. like at step 3 along with cleaning the data. Visualizing data during data exploration will help you understand the distribution of your data. It can also help you determine if a linear relationship is present, or if a non linear one is more appropriate."
v4ve6y,ib68qfw,20,No.
v4ve6y,ib71s1p,5,"For basic questions at a company that has a history of good data collection, sometimes it is this straightforward. 

But the reality: 

1. You have to help them formulate the questions. Or you start with questions and they keep adding more questions and you have to get them to narrow it down to which questions are truly important. 

2. Collect the data … this is a job (or more than one job) in and of itself. Figure out what data needs to be collected, how granular, make sure you have the tech in place to collect it and good data pipelines for storage and accessibility. 

3. Even if step 2 is done really well, you’ll still have to do some cleaning. This could take awhile and often you might come back to this step repeatedly. 

4. If step 1 was really clear, and step 2 done well, and your cleaning also done well, then this part should be straightforward. But it might take you down more rabbit holes and generate more questions. Sometimes you have to set boundaries for yourself because you could spend quite a bit on time on analysis. I usually do enough to have something to present, or timebox myself, but keep a list of other things I can analyze if my initial analysis isn’t enough. 

5. Visualization can be tough because everyone processes data differently. Some like visuals. Some want the actual data. Most want both. You also want to limit what you share so you don’t overwhelm your audience. You also only want to share what’s relevant, otherwise they’ll start getting hung up on irrelevant stuff you included “just because.” Every visual should tell a story and an answer a question and more importantly - should be relevant! 

Often you get to the end and they have *more* questions, or you have more questions, so you start over or go back to an earlier step."

xl3pe2,ipih590,22,"This guy is very right. In many cases, it’s better to have a deep understanding of business needs and figure out the data issues because a great data analyst can’t analyze if they don’t know what to ignore and look for. 

Great post"
xl3pe2,ipigstm,8,"On point. As someone with heavy finance/banking/financial markets background, I'm aiming to get a DA/DS job at an investment bank, as this is where I see my best chance."
xl3pe2,ipi0szz,6,What search terms should I look for when looking for books with regards to the topics you talked about?
xl3pe2,ipk9xkb,3,"I followed a similar path! I actually started in sales  right out of college. Got my MBA while working as a salesman and transitioned into mortgage. Worked mortgage for a couple of years until I realized I just wasn't happy with sales, so I went back *again* to get an additional concentration in data analytics along with a boot camp course. It took 2 years and a 150 job applications, but I've been a business analyst for over a year now, and have been loving every second of it! I've never been happier!

I totally agree! You don't have to be an expert, but be trainable and willing to learn! And never forget how important your soft skills are in their field (especially if you're on the business analyst side where you're talking with internal clients!!!). My soft skills are half the reason I got my job over other applicants. They just liked me more than the others and wanted to work with me."
xl3pe2,iphw17o,2,"I appreciate this! Even though you have formal education in these fields, where would you suggest to learn more of the business language and gain an understanding of it outside of college or university programs?"
xl3pe2,ipj5p3i,1,"I agree. For any business analyst, knowledge of their sector is something that will only improve their overall performance. 

This industry knowledge can be the difference between an analyst who gives people what they ask for, and an analyst who gives people what they need before they have to ask for it."
xl3pe2,ipjuxcn,1,"What good books on finance, accounting, and marketing do you recommend?"
xl3pe2,ipkkax3,1,Good advice that I'd love to incorporate into a project.
xl3pe2,ipko14h,1,"Thank you so much. Can you provide some resources where we can gain business, accounting, finance related knowledge? It will be great."
xl3pe2,ipltmer,1,"Sorry but i have to disagree. I have strong technical skills and even strong business knowledge (past work experience, bachelors degree heavily focused on IT AND business), i even have 2 projects to present. Yet i still keeping getting rejected, even when i am a perfect fit, they say “nothing wrong with you, just there are stronger candidates”. Stronger than 5+ yrs of experience? It all comes down to luck and like-ability 

TLDR: it’s about luck and likability, especially in your case. Technical skills are needed and business knowledge might help you stand out, but even with everything you need luck"

zull8f,j1k22og,4,Did you not get a return offer for the internship? Honestly I’d keep applying for a FAANG position if you’ve already had an internship there. Installing computers at medical sites would seem very physical

You learned stuff during the internship? On what basis did they give it to you?"
zull8f,j1n2a5s,1,was the FAANG internship some type of welcoming program for beginners? how were you accepted if you didn't know enough? (genuine question)
zull8f,j1owqr6,1,Congrats! I also graduated with a Biology and then did a Masters in DA. Started working this month at a major bank and liking it so far!
zull8f,j1r69ma,1,Hey! Congrats. I recently completed my undergrad in biomedical science and looking to switch in data analysis. I see that you previously had an experience from your research. I am also looking for some experience (have 0 so far). Any suggestions where can a person with 0 experience start? Like it's so hard to get entry as an absolute beginner.

xgzlhg,ioux5xm,30,Can you better define strong LinkedIn profile?
xgzlhg,iovieka,19,"I just came across this sub; this is essential advice. 

I would also add to take the Premium option for as long as your search is going. You are able to see salary comparisons, as well as the experience other applicants are bringing. 

Connect with people with the job you want and see what they add to their bio. Once you get your first job through the platform, you end up getting sought out endlessly by recruiters."
xgzlhg,iowsfvd,6,"Same as you! I realised that all 3 of my last jobs I got like this, through recruiters contacting me via linkedin. CV was asked only after the first one or two initial calls. 
Also, might be a coincidence but it was always recruiters working with the hr of the company, never any agencies.

Never really had any luck so far with applying directly.
Messages from recruiters I mostly ignore, until I get one from a well known company and/or an interesting enough salary. 

It’s good to have a strong LinkedIn profile, with many connections, and tags for relevant skills"
xgzlhg,iow5s3f,5,I feel desperate why it's that hard to find a job
xgzlhg,ioxfbqv,5,100% agree. As a hiring manager I have seen very few candidates that actually applied to an open position. Our recruiters reach out to promising canditates directly on Linkedin.

u6pjy8,i650qyu,1,"I regret losing my money to this company. I dont want other people to feel the regret. I posted this review comment under another post, I think this should also be here...

Here is an honest review about programs of Brainnest ;

(Spoiler : Do not waste your money on these programs)

Answer to the question (Is it scam?) : No

It is not a scam because the program is actually exists. When you check the company's Linkedln page, they have 50 thousand followers, almost 300 workers. You might think that this is a good growing company and feel more relaxed about the program. (I dont know anything about company, just checked the linkedin page, their office's location is not very satisfying,) BUT the main problem starts at the content and mechanism of the program.

We are talking about a good marketing strategy here. The strategy depends on exploiting hope of people who is struggling to find a job. They got me when I feel so depressed about not finding a job and got a lot of rejections. Therefore, I did not investigate much, did not ask questions, I just wanted to pay that money and got training. It seemed like an open road for me for finding a job at that time. However, I strongly believe that their main aim is not providing an industry based training, only making money from people. (I talked about company's aim not tutor's aim. Tutor was very nice and hard-working about the structure of program)

Before telling you the story about the program, I just wanted to say that you develop your skills and increase your information about the topic very easily for free by using the internet.

As far as I understand, they had an agreement with some PhD candidates for the courses. Tutors are very nice but the program is more research oriented (you can guess from PhD candidate tutors from different areas like psychology etc.).  For example, we used SPSS for the data analysis homeworks but if you check the industry, you can see that SPSS is not a common used tool. Python,R,Sql etc. are mostly used.

If you want to spend your money on a short university  course (beginner statistics-data analysis),  go ahead but I believe that this is strongly unnecessary.  In addition, it should be noted that their training description doesn't match with what they provide. It is basically paying and getting a certificate."

Take it this way: even if you fail spectacularly in this new job (which you won't) the amount of knowledge and experience will be PHENOMENAL. Plus, you can STILL go back to your old industry after that, just with extra skills under your belt.

It will be a little tough for a year or so, be ready to do a lot of your own research and eduction outside of work if you want to really blow it out of the water.

Fake it till you make it. Do it."
te6bkm,i0nz7zo,5,"You already know about the business side of things, so that's more free time you will have to get on par with the more technical side.

Google is your friend, and whenever there is something you don't know how to do in sql you just Google it and generally the 1st or 2nd result will do the trick (here is where your wits are going to play a big part, in adapting other people's answers into your problems).

If you feel like what you just googled is going to repeat itself, you can add it to a big sql script and you will start compiling a list of useful things (like ranking positions with a window function using a CTE or how to properly aggregate columns, grouping the others and joining tables.)

You have the data fetching side which is sql, now you need a way to present the data to your stakeholders. Most people unfortunately prefer spreadsheets which is extremely limited since you can only have 5kk (10kk I believe now) of cells, and if you have a couple of columns with a couple hundred thousand rows (which is not that much depending on the business) that limit comes fast. So probably you will need to learn either tableau, Looker or some other bi tool.

If you are new to them I highly recommend you to use data studio if that's a possibility, otherwise you will have to use whatever they use, and there are probably some stuff already made which you will be able to learn from (it is not expected for you to build things from 0).

Depending on the bi tool they use they will break more or less often, plus there will be things that stakeholders want different, and you will start doing that as well, first attending a meeting with some other colleague, then you execute the task while asking questions when needed (always try to actually do something before saying that you don't know what to do, again, Google is your friend).

If they offered you the position they have evaluated your profile and believe you could be a valuable asset, don't let the impostor syndrome get you down and learn while you are doing it.

Also, there probably will be data engineers present so you don't have to worry about drop table, updating or creating tables and other scary stuff

Best of lucks brother, and I'm sorry for your loss."

In short, I say go for it bc you’re already more prepared than I was.

ETA: OP, a old colleague just told me about DataCamp and how you can get a subscription for around $140 for the year and you can take courses to learn all levels of data analysis. Might be worth looking into."
te6bkm,i0o1olk,3,"Congrats on the job offer! I'm excited for you and I hope the opportunity is good to you.


It's on the hiring team to decide if you're qualified or not before making that offer. As long as you presented qualifications honestly and openly (Example of not doing so would be like saying you have particular certification when you don't yet, that kind of thing), then you're as qualified as they need. 


You've shown an aptitude for learning the tech and you have the business field knowledge (your past experience in education) already, so that's a great combo. A lot of the job is trained on what exactly they want how they want and a big part of the rest of the job is your ability to figure out what you need to know as you need it. You've shown you can do that last part! I've got the master's degree in data analytics, but what's taking me a while on my new-ish job (one month in) now is learning that particular business sector. Your previous knowledge and experience will be more valuable than someone with all the formal training in data analytics but none of the practical knowledge of the data."

In the real world / job market, what you would typically do is pull data from your company’s databases, most typically using SQL of some sort. So if you’re practicing data analysis with the hopes of getting a job doing that, I would focus on using sources where you can pull from a database as the initial step rather than just downloading a csv or whatever. OR have your first step be to upload that data to a database of some sort and then do your analysis from there."

I learned about data viz and big data more to be a better engineer in a world of industry 4.0 . I was in a research program for more than 2 years at University, so my knowledge in analytics wasn't so bad, but financial wasn't my field, right? 
In the first months I was like... What I know? What I'm doing here? I always asked everything and after some time I learned that is the point. 
You will be the data specialist. You make the questions as a detective. It's the job. With time you will learn make the right questions, show the right numbers and tell the best history. Every company, each new position will be this way ( if you don't follow an only field) .
As I said, I'm in a beauty company and I worked in supply,  intelligence , franchisee, d2d, b2c , almost for transformation office, and now planning and performance. 
Or company is becoming data driven and is very hard show to my colleagues that they have to learn to use data to prove some point of view or project. But, once again, it's the job. 
Don't worry. The data world is a place of a lot fun. Every day you will see the data for a different point of view an knowledge. Nobody is right. Nobody is wrong. You just don't see the world as the same way your colleagues and that's ok. It's here that you will be the data specialist. Ask for them to show you their presentations, how is their regular problems. Make propositions : and if we are capable to see this data for this way? 
Use your lack as an opportunity. 
You are in this position because someone saw in you something. Maybe a hard skill in a software, or well your degree as an engineer ( I don't know which one but calculus was a very hard time, but on of the easiest math we took in university) .

tjao5o,i1jkhte,42,"I just finished my data analysis program. Portfolio is everything. I did three major projects in school.

1. I used data from a car rental company, about 4 sheets of raw data on excel. Cleaned it up, made an interactive drop down menu on an excel sheet as the cover that switches between 4 strategies. I recommended these 4 strategies for increase in their net revenue in the excel sheet as well as in a separate powerpoint presentation. The analysis portion included observations and solutions. (They were losing money on certain car models, and some car models did better in certain locations across the U.S., stuff like that.) This was was all about excel and powerpoint, wrangling data with functions, organization, ease of communication.
2. Helped an investment bank make more money. The data was real estate data with everything you could possibly want to know about a house. When it was built, bedroom/bathrooms, square footage, fireplace, pool, garage, driveway, road access, structural quality, sale price, neighborhood, and many more categories. Had to use statistical tests to figure out which factors were driving up the sale price the most. Then make recommendations to the bank on which houses to invest in. This one showcases more my Statistics, Tableau, and SQL, as well as excel and powerpoint.
3. This one I got to choose so I compared pokemon types and stats across all Pokemon games. Also compared win rates in competitive play to see if certain pokemon with certain stat thresholds or elemental types were winning more often. This one showcased my Python skills more.

I think you should aim to do projects like these to highlight your software skills, analytical skills, and presentation skills.

I used some data sets from this website. They have a lot. When you get further along in your program, I recommend you look through some data sets, pick one that interests you and see what you can do with it.

* Data collection tools (e.g., Xplenty, BrightData, GoSpotCheck, etc)
* Data cleaning tools (e.g., IBM Infosphere Quality Stage, Drake, etc)
* BI tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, Looker, QlikSense, etc.)
* Statistical analysis tools (e.g., SPSS, R, MS Excel, MatLab, SAS, etc.)
* Data science and machine learning platforms (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks, MATLAB, KNIME, etc)

* Programming: R, Python, SQL. If you have a Computer Science degree, you may not have a problem.
* Business: Excel and Reporting (Tableu, PowerBI). Also, Business knowledge like Marketing, Finance or Logistics. You need to know what is NPS or CRM, process bottle necks and other management stuff.

wkf0o3,ijo9oo4,140,"I am going to give you a plan that will be you absolute best shot at getting a Data Analyst job.

For background, I went from Data Analyst to Senior Data Analyst to Data Scientist in just under 3 years.  I have also helped a few other people close to me get into the industry.

* **STOP** working on the machine learning course.  It is absolutely useless to you.  You don't yet have the qualifications to be a data scientist and 99% of data analyst don't use those skills.  Your time is better spent elsewhere.
* **FOCUS** on getting to advanced or Expert level SQL skills.  Can you use Window Functions, correlated subqueries, etc. While many courses teach things out of order, any course the covers that is almost certain to cover everything else you need with SQL.  SQL is the most important skill a data analyst can have.
* **DEVELOP** decent to strong Tableau skills.  I generally tell people to get good at either Tableau or Power BI, since those are the two most popular Reporting/Visualization tools in corporate America.  
* **GET** a Tableau certification.  You can either get the Desktop Specialist or the new Tableau Data Analyst certification.  It doesn't matter.  This is just to get you past the HR screener.  I am sorry to say that your Google certificate probably doesn't mean much (REGARDLESSS of what YouTube influencers say) because a recruiter in Human Resources has probably never heard of it.  Get certified in the tools that the job requires.
* **LOOK** primarily (maybe even ONLY) at healthcare related companies and positions.  Here you are leveraging your healthcare experience. Look especially at HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES.  That is where I worked.  They are some of the largest healthcare companies and hire ton of data analysts since they have a ton of data.  Get a list of the 15 largest healthcare companies in the country, the 15 largest heath insurance companies in the country, and the largest healthcare companies locally.  Go directly to the ""careers"" section of their website
* **SEARCH** for jobs based on skills rather than title.  Tons of people have data analyst positions that aren't actually called data analysts.  Instead of searching for ""data Analyst"" search for ""SQL Tableau Healthcare"".  My former company employed HUNDREDS of data analysts, but maybe 4 had the actual name ""data analyst.""
* **CUSTOMIZE** your resume to the position.  Reading that you applied to 150-200 jobs (and only got one interview) tells me that you 1) are just applying to anything and everything that is a data analyst position and 2) are not customizing your resume. 
* **EMPHASIZE** your experience in healthcare,  in your summary statement you could say something like ""SQL and Tableau expert with 6 years healthcare experience, transitioning to a data focused role in the healthcare industry....""
* **APPLY** directly on the company's website whenever possible.  If you can avoid applying on LinkedIn or Indeed, or through a contracting company, then go directly to the company.  However, if you have to apply through a third party, then do it.
* **BUILD** a portfolio project **with real data.**  This is more for the interview with the hiring manager, although you can have it listed in the projects section of your resume.  What would be a good project?  how about one that is healthcare related.  Where do you get the data?  The Affordable Care Act resulted in a TON of health insurance information being publicly available.  Did you know that the premium and deductible rates for every health insurance plan, at every age range, is available online at a government website?  That is just one idea.  When you talk to the hiring manager, talk about how you managed problems with real data (misspellings, missing data, etc.).

I really hope this helps.  Healthcare is one of the most data intensive industries around.  You can leverage your prior experience to get your foot in the door."
wkf0o3,ijmxnds,19,">I have experience with Tableau, Excel, Sheets, SQL, Python, R, and feel pretty comfortable using all of these. I have a portfolio showcasing what I can do for work. I have **six years of experience working in healthcare**

w20v9f,ih4xy0i,1,"I'm not annoyed by the posts, and sometimes they are interesting, but there is a disturbing trend of people trying to break into this field with no relevant education, skills, or experience. Theres simply too many social media tech gurus out there promoting this field as an easy way to get into tech with no college degree and that's why we are seeing these posts so frequently. I don't want to dash anyones hopes but I think we should be responsible telling people how to get into DA/DS. Is it *technically* true that you can be a DA with no degree? Sure. But is telling people that you don't need a degree to become a DA the honest thing to say when like 90% of DAs have a Bachelors and higher? It's like all the data people suddenly forget what an outlier is when the topic of degree vs no degree come up. Giving people false hope is a really messed up thing to do especially when they can end up wasting a lot of time and money on certificates and bootcamps."

Hi everybody,  
  
Thank you so much for all of your support. Please give me a little bit of time to get everything uploaded from last night. I need to work through a couple of things, get the code pushed to Github, and I will be posting the full VOD in its entirety to Youtube sometime in the next day or two.

Additionally, thank you to the moderators for allowing this post.  
  
I know originally I wanted to keep it on Twitch, however, the video will be posted to Youtube. You can find a link to my Youtube here.  
  
Due to the overwhelming amount of positive feedback, we will be doing this more regularly, however, as more segments (perhaps one stream for EDA, one for model selection, one for tuning, one for insights).  
  
My profile now includes mostly all links to my socials for us to stay connected.

Thanks for your patience and understanding as I work through this for the first time.  
  
Yours,

10zwafm,j862xt0,20,"I’m confused as to why you ever decided to do this?! You’re going to have to put in double time just to keep your head above water, and even then who knows if you’ll be able to. You should quit if you can to refocus. Sounds like maybe your husband convinced you of this?"
10zwafm,j86311n,26,"First of all, everyone's got impostor syndrome. **Don't let it ruin your life or close a door prematurely.** Most people learn on the job, which it sounds like you're doing, but not everyone sticks it out and makes it to the other side. Those that do are the ones hungry to learn. 

I think the principal question here is are you interested and willing to learn? If you find the idea of doing analysis fun or exciting (independent of your own perception of yourself and ability to do it), then you CAN learn. The key here is to distinguish your feelings about the subject itself separate from your own perceived aptitude. You won't know if you're any good until you've tried your best.

It sounds like your coworkers think the joint efforts of you and your husband (who's effectively acting as your manager) are okay. You can make a learning plan to transition into someone more autonomous - try the project out yourself, use chatgpt-3 to unblock, and get your husband to review instead of heavily revise. 

If, however, the answer is that you dislike the work itself, then why try climbing a ladder that only leads to despair? Taking a pause, re-evaluating, and finding something more suitable may be better. You will walk away with the confidence knowing that you were able to talk your way into an opportunity. You'll do it again, but aimed at something better. 

Don't be too hard on yourself! Life is hard enough. During times of strife, we all have to believe that we're on our own side. Regardless of what you choose, you will make it out alive."
10zwafm,j88npw9,4,"First and foremost, relax. That's not a lot of money in the data field and the expectations for your performance I assume aren't that high. That being said, I'm concerned that you haven't picked up on the tools to do your job. Almost every job has significant downtime, especially with someone helping you. You're telling me you didn't have 4 hours to learn advanced excel functions on YouTube? You can buy an SQL course online and learn it in a week. You probably don't need to know R/Python or advanced statistics at that salary. What's really going on here? Are you working remotely while taking care of the kids at the same time?"
10zwafm,j893e1v,4,"I'm in a similar situation as a middle-aged convert to data analysis. I took that first job and for two years was over my head, drowning. Every insecurity I had came out and while my coworkers did everything they could to help, I continued to repeatedly crash and burn.

I didn't have the vertigo but other serious symptoms, which were managed by a lot of therapy … a lot of therapy. At work, it got to the point of a performance improvement plan that I knew I could not complete so I left that job. Being a little older than you, I have (had?) some savings which made that a reasonable choice.

Because my data experience is both shallow and narrow, I am not getting the offers. I want to focus on what I'm good at and get better. I'm looking for something in data that will allow me to learn at a more gradual and sustainable rate.

I got into data after a relatively successful career in designing books, magazines, records and such. I can tell you that most entry level data positions pay more than I made after 20yrs as a designer.

y195rf,iryrmai,4,"What sort of feedback are you receiving from management? 

Analytical thinking isn’t something you learn overnight or even from one course, you have to build on it as you gain experience. It’s starts out with knowing patterns in your data and doing quick tests or summaries that confirm your intuition when you’re stuck. Having an understanding of what the data is, where is comes from and how it interacts with other data or business is key. 

As for presentations, I’m not the right person to give advice since I struggle even though I’m a manager now, which is quite embarrassing but ultimately the point of a presentation is to convey information. The best way to do that is to first understand what you’re presenting. Then think about how you will present and in what steps, who the audience is and what their level of understanding is. Next you play devil’s advocate and try to figure out what others are going to ask you. It’s not always about explaining the technical sides of things, that’s important but often times the business people and higher ups are thinking about feasibility, usefulness and action-ability of what you’re presenting."

sgk66h,hux0ixb,50,"I don't think it's necessarily a saturated field. We have difficulty finding good analysts, emphasis on good. It's hard to be a good analyst. I'd wager a larger portion of those applicants have Excel listed as one of their only skills for analysis and another portion who have probably stretched the truth. It's definitely grown in popularity, though. The work is generally not too demanding and the pay is good. I make as much as a nurse does and work probably half as hard, and all from home. That has taken years to accomplish, though, but I think that is the reason for the profession's growth. 

Some of the other careers you mentioned take different paths to employment as well. Nurses are generally fed into the profession through clinicals, schools etc."
sgk66h,huwtrz3,21,"Agreed. One Sr./Lead Analytics job I applied for had 788 applications and that was just on Indeed. Can’t imagine how many total applications there were if you combined all the job sites. 

I think it has a lot to do with it being a newer profession than medicine or engineering. I’m older than most on here, but when I started college, I don’t even remember there being anything about an analytics degree. Maybe one or 2 classes, but not an actual degree.

Edit: wanted to add that analytics is so broad that a lot of analytic jobs can be created in all industries. It’s not just sequestered to one or two professions."
sgk66h,huxngfu,11,"Well when you have Google offering a certificate you can complete in a few months and they’re selling that was a way to break into the industry, folks probably think there is a low bar to entry.
Couple that with all the articles talking about demand and “sexy data science” and high salaries and you can see why people would take their chances. 

Also the number of applicants doesn’t reflect number of *qualified* applicants. It’s still really hard to find folks for experienced roles. 

Also… why did you enter this field? Perhaps those folks liked it for the same reasons."
sgk66h,huwug88,10,"I can only speak for myself, but I love math and shaping alot of data in to actionable information. If data analytics was around 25 years ago when I got my EE degree, I would have concentrated in it instead of digital sigal processing"
sgk66h,huxrdv4,29,"I just went through the process of hiring a data analyst and we got about 75 applications. A lot of the applicants were instant rejections. A lot of people seem to think this job is open for anyone who finishes a google analytics certificate and know how to open excel. If you have a STEM degree and you aren't terrible at coding and know some statistics then you are already ahead of like 90% of applicants for the entry level stuff.   


I don't want to sound mean and I don't want to discourage people. I believe that this kind of job is really great for anyone with some kind of domain knowledge and wants to try something different, but doing a few online certificates isn't gonna cut it in most cases."
sgk66h,huxqshy,9,"Partially, it's a data flow issue.  Some years ago, when it was relatively new to create positions called data analysts, there was a large demand relative to people applying for those jobs.  People heard that   
* you could train up quickly (true for entry level),    
* that you didn't need a degree (true for skill acquisition, true early on when there was a demand imbalance and there were few programs offering a ""data analyst"" degree),   
* that it was a fun thing to do (depending on what people like), and   
* that it paid well (relatively true vs. requirements particularly early on.    
   
Time has passed.  People flooded the field.   Universities started offering programs (and using outdated information to encourage enrollment for those programs).  The demand increased but nowhere near as fast as supply.  There is now a vast oversupply of entry level candidates.  There's still some demand for those with some experience which is a much smaller cohort."

sgk66h,huwv8b3,18,Its a job where you don't need to go to school specifically for it. There's quite a few people who went to school for something else but want to change careers.
sgk66h,hux0csl,5,"I think the best situation (that I'm in) that diversifies you as a data analyst is having 2 degrees with one focusing specifically on the industry you're in. Marketing, chem/bio, finance, etc. with another higher degree in analytics or something. Not only are you more qualified in terms of education, you're much more likely to be picked over another applicant who is strictly coming from a tech/data analyst background and has 0 industry or business background that truthfully impacts the way you interpret and analyze data your entire career. I mean I have background in marketing but learn new shit every day that makes me interpret data differently constantly. For someone without a marketing background or industry background I'm not sure how they are actually accurately analyzing the same data. Like at all lol... guess work? You can 100% identify trends and make conclusions or observe significance, but that doesn't always explain why or how it's happening-- which affects the final business decision.

Also lots of techies want to get into ML, Nn, etc, and data analyst is one of the first steps towards that unfortunately-- majorly diluting the field. 

Data analyst now are like programming jobs when they first became a thing, and lots of people recognize that. Major industry credit for being one + high pay and career opportunity.

Plus data analyst jobs vary greatly in terms of job duties do many people can apply and perform. But if you have background in ag, manufacturing, tech, cars, art/digital media, marketing, etc. Etc. you will see the numbers drop and your opportunity really will show. It's competitive but the job market literally right now is extremely hot"

xyut6f,irke765,6,"Other than orders by hour, most of those charts are not best practice for the information you are trying to display. Note how long you have to look at the pie chart by flavour to actually see who is marginally larger.. the quarterly trends, why not just have monthly and bar chart it.

I’d rewrite the blurb in the sales by category section. “Whereas Classic pizzas are ordered more than every else category,” doesn’t sound nice. Take out whereas from every sentence you used it in."
xyut6f,irld95g,2,"1. Lose the first row of info, they know how many recipes they have and the other info you have it in the chart, related to point 4.
2. Check your words, you have sales, profit and revenue, those are not the same, you can have a lot of sales but no profit, so make sure that you mean those things.
3. Change all the top cards to the same width and alignment.
4. Start with the most profitable quarter and month, then busiest day and hour, next the charts of size and recipe and finally the liked disliked, of the most important info to the more detailed.
5. If you have multiple years of data, change the line chart of quarter results to represent each year with a line, and make it monthly instead of quarterly, to see the tendency each year and verify if there's one.
6. In the analysis of the most profitable quarter and month, the busiest day and the busiest hour I would suggest make a promotion or something to try to reduce the gap between those numbers, because the installed capacity can be overflow or underflow, in that type of business a steady flow of customers it's best, because the necessary personel and fixed costs, that's why i suggest to change quarters to months, because you can make promotions by month, even per week.
7. I would add a scatter plot of the busiest day and hour (X and Y axis), to see the relation between those two dimensions.
8. Lose the pie charts, they look nice but are difficult to read, use a bar chart, horizontal or vertical.
9. Erase the vertical center line behind the two area charts in the pie charts rows.
10. The analysis in the two area charts are very subjective, I wouldn't adventure to make those suggestions, you don't know why the sales and the orders behave that way exactly, you have to do a more profound analysis to make that suggestions.
11. The most liked and disliked pizzas chart is confusing, I don't know if you have a exact number of how much likes or dislikes have each flavor, but if you don't have those numbers, change the charts to a tornado chart or a horizontal bar chart, with the liked pizzas in the positive side and the disliked pizzas in the negative chart.Or better yet, make just one plot chart, Y axis sales, X axis orders, and the color of the dots can represent liked or disliked, if you have the number you can represent likes with the size or the color of the dot.

I make all these suggestions to help, I hope I'm not sounding rude because that's not the intention, good luck with your project.  


Edit: On second thought, the by size and by category charts can be scattered plots as well, X axis for sales and Y axis for orders, with that you can make only one chart instead of two, cleaner."

wwonil,ilme3t4,19,"Pick up a data visualization tool, I recommend Tableu, and make a few projects using free online datasets. 

Your projects should probably be related to something you have some domain knowledge in.  A good data analyst doesn’t just visualize existing data with graphs, they visualize data in a way to emphasize trends and present it in a way that guides strategic, data-driven, problem solving. 

When you make a project, be prepared to talk about what problem you are addressing and how your project helps solve that problem. Without previous experience, if you can’t talk in detail about your thought processes and decision making within your project, you won’t have much chance at getting hired.

zzqdwo,j2e9o7e,25,"I had no experience with Data Analytics as a career, and come from twenty years of IT background, so comfortable learning new technical knowledge.

What I liked so much about the course was the sense of immersion and teamwork (although artificial), it gave me a sense of what Data Analysis is about, what it's for, and _who_ it's for: the stakeholders.  This is real life.

Technical skills are great - I love learning about Python Pandas & Jupiter notebooks from other courses.  But the whole point is the product, the delivery, the service: what can you bring to the table, what useful business insights can you provide to the team to make a better, more profitable move based on your data collection and analysis.

I recommend this course as a great intro for the data analytics novice, but you must participate and invest yourself into it, like any other project.  Otherwise it will be a waste of time for you.

Finally I will say that after finishing this course, I springboarded into Udemy courses on much more advanced SQL, Python Pandas for Data Analysis and Tableau, and of course practice practice practice!"

zzqdwo,j2d1j81,29,"I don't think it is. I knocked it out in an afternoon. The only time it's been asked about in an interview, they asked me how I found it to 'gauge my level', and when I said 'meh, I knocked it out in an afternoon and didn't really learn anything new from it' I felt like that was the *correct* answer.

I am honestly unsure whether I should leave it on my CV or not. I think it was pushed really hard by a pile of influencers, I suspect as part of sponsorship deals, but it is really questionable in practice.

Pretty much what you said - other e-learning things that didn't provide 'certifications' provided much more challenge and value to me. The only potential values of the Google cert are that it gives you a verifiable 'certificate' and says 'Google' on it."

yzngqm,ix1bmib,18,"I would learn Excel, SQL, and then Tableau or PowerBI in that order if you are not proficient at any of them yet.  I think these are the main core three skills that cover more analytics jobs than not.

Learn the basics of each before moving on to the next, unless you are really liking and picking things up easily, then I would continue through the intermediate skills before moving on to the next.  Once you have the basics / intermediate levels down, pick which one you enjoyed the best and move to more advanced topics on that one.  Keep refreshing what you've learned with the other two.

When you are comfortable with one, and feel you have strong skills in the other two, then move on to something else like R or Python if you want.

40 years ago I was offered a job doing night shift backups on a Honeywell mainframe that was running COBAL. Acoustic modem couplers, 9-track ISAM tapes, 128 MB platter stacks. I was so afraid I would fail again, but that was the turning point in a successful IT career. 

30 years ago I was the US IT manager for a Dutch firm that communicated with dumb VT52 terminals over a transcontinental X.25 net. Windows was either version one or two by then, running on a Novell network. 

Now at age 70 I am a decent Oracle DBA on an agile team, learning Amazon Web services on the fly, in addition to artifact deployment using the Altassian tool suite, for a customer who is committed to the zero trust initiative.

yzngqm,ix1llyy,5,"Imposters syndrome is real and everyone experiences it, especially in analytics.

What's your education, work experience, and background?"
yzngqm,ix1nyr9,4,"Learning those skills alone seems overwhelming, however I recommend you focus on use cases with each. Find an open source dataset from somewhere like Kaggle and develop a Tableau dashboard that tells a story about the data. It is what I did during my masters and my course projects are still in my Public profile! As far as R, perhaps after doing a small tutorial on syntax you could learn a couple of algorithms and compare their performance against a sample data set such as [Iris](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris). Leetcode has interesting SQL exercises and plenty of courses online (Udacity just made theirs [free](https://www.udacity.com/course/learn-sql--nd072?utm_source=gsem_brand&utm_medium=ads_r&utm_campaign=12712700850_m_individuals&utm_term=124530975990&utm_keyword=udacity%20sql_e&gclid=CjwKCAiAmuKbBhA2EiwAxQnt78HYMAWseXQOCf9JKN1PWpLdWZATEzLd7hkgj9r_pkCZ-kMxzbPB2hoC564QAvD_BwE), I highly recommend that platform.) Once you have a defined objective it is easier to apply and learn the skills that you are trying to master, and they will make sense to you. I have to say after working in Analytics for half a year it makes so much more sense now than when I started! You just need to start :)"

yk4ppb,iurbrwa,90,"DA is a seemingly approachable subject so the requirements users provide are often prescriptive and not descriptive. It can make the process of scoping deliverables uncomfortable as you slowly reveal to them that what they asked for is the wrong thing.

Typically when I am given a bunch of descript instructions I retort with. ""What is it you're trying to measure and why"". Then we work it back and renegotiate the how based on available data and their needs. I carefully point out how the original proposal would have given suboptimal or downright useless results and then we proceed.

Almost nobody really knows what they want. They just think they do. We have to navigate this carefully to not injure egos and that's a weird task to fall on data analysts."

yk4ppb,ius0rwt,28,"Nobody really knows what they want, they only have an idea and it's your job to navigate through indecisions, backs and forths, almost act like an therapist to know what the hell they want to solve and how to give feedback without hurting their souls (but they don't mind threating you like garbage).

You work with data, but no one knows what data is. Sometimes I have to explain what is average and what is percentage. Is that bad for some people. So, not only you are their therapist, you are also their math teacher.

You will do a lot of things that will require a lot of work and will be used only for a few minutes. Sometimes it could be prevented, sometimes it's just how it is. And this happens a lot. Some things requires a lot of work just to be used for a short period of time, specially with you are in a startup scenario, when everything changes so fast. It's important to be very grounded with this because I see lots of people complaining their work is not being used (I mean good work, not a bag of garbage your stakeholder didn't ask for).

The one thing that really bothers me is how everything is ""urgent"" and unplanned. You have multiple stakeholders wanting answers for yesterday. And they don't care if you are overworked or in a pre burnout, they just want their demands to be delivered. People will complain that they have asked you ""something so simple"" and you are asking them a couple days to do your job. Then you make some miracle and deliver it on time. And they take days to even look at what you've done. Or they look at your data and make a decision based at intuition or whatever they use to justify it. Of course the level of this can change based on the company and industry you are, but this will happen for sure. If there is one topic I really don't like about the profession, is this one."
yk4ppb,ius4ic9,29,"Stakeholders with zero technical knowledge telling you what they asked you for is 'quick' and 'easy'. In reality the data is scattered, messy and inconsistent, and you have to come up with some convoluted workaround to answer their questions"

2- Scope/Requirements creep. I do a lot of converting manual processes to automated (basically converting PowerPoints to dashboards). Once you make the dashboard, people then keep asking for extra things within the dashboard. When they are lower level it's easy to just say no, when they are high up, you end up just adding and adding to no end. 

3- People that don't understand how data works. The amount of time you make something and explain it, some people will immediately discount anything you say because of the silliest reasons. ""Well, this data is from yesterday."" or ""Well I track this on my own spreadsheet."" Ok Carol, but that's dumb when we have a database that takes less time to updates than your stupid spreadsheet.

That said I love my job. Every job has annoyances, but they day in day out work here is fantastic. I love the problem solving that comes with it and I get to flash my creativity.

uvczpy,i9krbgn,80,"I would say that the certificate is **not** enough to land you a job. I had interviews recently for entry level DA jobs and no one asked or even acknowledged my IBM certificate. They were much more focused on my portfolio, so I would say do the certificate to learn the basics but expand on that by building out a good portfolio showcasing SQL, Tableau/PowerBI and Python/R.

Edit: You don't have to be *great* at coding for an entry level role but you need to know the fundamentals of SQL and basics of Python/R & Tableau/PowerBI at the very minimum."
uvczpy,i9mura2,14,"I was unemployed for about 4 months, did the certificate in one and a half.

The certificate itself will not land you an entry level job on its face value, IMO. The skills will but only if you showcase them. It’s 8 modules with the last being a capstone portfolio project where you put it all together. It’s optional and self paced—they give you ideas but nothing more. It’ll definitely help you get a job if you do the portfolio and really showcase what you know. But if you’re getting it just to have it then don’t waste your time."

uvczpy,i9nwx2n,3,"I’m from a similar background. Tried applying for jobs with Google tag manager certification but that was no use. Data analysis is more sophisticated than that. I learnt sql - through some free online  resources - https://www.w3schools.com/sql/
 and low priced course in Udemy. The thing about sql is you’ll find ‘variations’ of them when you look them up. There’s MS t-sql and pl sql and postgre sql etc.  it’s a pretty standard language, with standard format which means if you learn any one of them you’ll pick up the other variations quite easily. 

I learnt sql, brushed up basic statistics (udacity has a great free course), learnt basic power bi (again free courses available online, i think on MS site too and Udemy). These helped getting my cv noticed. Since I wasn’t working back then I had time (and desperation) to download datasets from websites like Kaggle, Microsoft has a sample dataset and Googled to get a few more. Created basic reports and used them as my sample projects to showcase my skill level.. the rest as they say is history 😂"

sp9wvm,hwdtsw8,17,Hey - I'm in a similar situation. Im 37 and just transitioned into data analysis 18 months ago with absolutely no prior background or IT experience. I luckily got onto a 6 month retraining scheme that paid me to retrain BUT I would say I actually learned more from doing things on my own in the evening or any free time. Some things that really helped me where website such as w3schools where you can learn and practice at the same time for free. I now have access to DataCamp through my work which is excellent but not sure how much it costs on an individual basis. Sounds like you are on the right path. I would maybe look into learning R as well as Python.
sp9wvm,hwe4ve2,13,If your company uses Python I wouldn’t look into R unless you just want to expand your knowledge down the field. The only benefit to R is the the packages it comes with and it’s free. A book I would recommend is SQL for data analytics Malik. Goldwasser. Johnston.. Also maybe R is better at data visualizations but I’m not sure cause I can’t do visualizations in python so maybe someone can confirm(i mainly use R). SQL at your company is probably just used for the data bases and data cleaning?
sp9wvm,hwg9rfx,4,I found strata scratch to be amazingly helpful with some hard SQL problems and concepts. Admittedly haven’t tried w3school but it’s another option for ya. Best of luck!

I am an IT specialist for a school system now but like you I had a career change from EMT to IT guy but don't think the cost-to-benefit ratio warrants going back to school and spending God knows how much on tuition and scheduling classes around work so I have been looking at alternative trainings to further my career.

vyd5c3,ig2koxe,43,"I’m on course 7 of 8 of the Google Certification, I’ve studied for 5-8 hours every day for the past month. I started networking and staying super active on LinkedIn, while also keeping my resume up to date and super clean for recruiters. 

I also did the beginner course on Khan Academy (which helped me understand SQL WAY better) (also its 100% free) AND I did a 1 hour crash course for PowerBI, which is available on YouTube, right after I finished course 6 (which goes over Tableau). I started building a portfolio now after the PowerBI course on YouTube, and I’ve already been reached out to by a recruiter for some entry level jobs in data. I have a 2nd interview coming up but I am still searching on LinkedIn on a daily basis. 

I’ve used my previous work experience to better adjust my skills on my resume to match data analysis, and so far it seems to be working. But this is where I’m at currently! A month and a half of super hard, mentally draining work and it seems to be paying off! If you set yourself up for success, and REALLY dedicate your time and efforts into the course, it will be VERY helpful for you down the road.

vufdov,ifd9j2q,36,I never used python personally but some of the other analyst I worked with used it for automating reports and side projects that landed them promotions.
vufdov,ifddcn9,13,"The things I do as a data analyst with python that SQL is not capable of:
- getting data from an api (system a)
- creating an automatic mailing process using the data I get with system a
- lets say that you work with multiple companies each of them uses different databases (nosql, rdmbs) you can use python to connect and do complex analysis for each of them"
vufdov,ifdrgfs,9,"I'm using python quite explicitly in my current job, haven't written one SQL query or created a single sheet in excel. 
I pull data from APIs, analyzing and manipulating it with numpy and pandas and scipy, and presnting it with plotly.."
vufdov,ifeai4c,7,"You can still be a good analyst without Python (or another language like R). I personally learned it to automate. When I left my first data analyst role they had to replace me with 2 people because I didn’t share my code. They thought I was super human, but I honestly only worked like 20 hours a week at most. 

You can write scripting to pull from your database, do all of your manipulation, aggregation, and visualization then email or upload it where ever it needs to go. If you get comfortable with Flask and Dash you can even build full dashboards that you can share or host. 

It has been super valuable as I have progressed in my career and begun working with big data. One company I worked for had several tables with over a billion records in them. It’s almost impossible to analyze that without code, and even then we had to run Python on a dedicated server because of the processing power needed."
vufdov,ifdc2sn,16,"Let me put it this way in a layman or in summary - Most folks used it Mainly  for data engineering stuff especially Python spark  library for creating automated data pipeline flow say from Mongo Db to Big Query to Data studio and that helps to refresh the data source (i used this currently at work so i don't want to bore you with too much technical stuff) and also by Data Scientist for Machine learning purposes- this also depends on your company what they wish to do with the business meta-data generated, daily some for forecasting share prices, stocks market monitoring, Bitcoin 
and so on

While some data Analyst use Python  for data manipulation, data cleaning, Regex stuff, and even moreso connecting to SQL Database and telling pandas to auto-update data and so on

Marketing analysts used iyt for scrapping data from websites like Amazon and so on using Selenium, bs4 etc

&#x200B;

iHope you do undestand right?"
vufdov,ifdx7wj,4,To piggie back on this question how is Python compared to R for analytics? I loved doing my case study in R and it was great from cleaning all the way to visuals. Does Python offer the same?
vufdov,ifddl6o,3,"This should be interesting to read about, since I'm still new to data. I'm still learning, so I don't know what is necessary and what is not. I've been practicing a few things on Kaggle, and on there, I've used Python (matplotlib, pandas, etc.) for some EDA and visualization."
vufdov,iff8soq,3,"Sql is limited to just talking to the database. Python has more functionalities. With python you can scrape data with APIs, do data querying & manipulating with pandas. Also python allows you to automate reports and dashboards."
vufdov,iffhe3c,3,"When I was an analyst I used python for all my regression work, a/b testing, and web scraping. All data analysts should be capable of performing linear and logistic regression imo"
vufdov,iffpins,3,"There seems to be some frustration here as it seems like you feel the need to learn Python but can't find a use case.  At the end of the day, if you are in a position where everything you need to do can be accomplished with those tools then go ahead and use them.   In a perfect setting those work the best.  But it's those weird edge cases where stuff is just messy where Python might be better.

My current position I end up pulling data from auto generated static files from multiple different sources that get uploaded throughout the day into a shared folder.  I can easily set up scripts that run on timed intervals to check for new files and pull them all in and do some joining and cleaning.

As far as the interactive reports.  I assume you are referring to being able to slice the data.  Web frameworks like dash/Plotly or streamlit are good choices.  It allows you to build out a frontend web application that anyone can view.

There will always be fighting between the best way to do things.  Go over to the r/VBA sub where legacy companies are literally built on top of spreadsheets and they will laugh at the idea of using python over VBA.  But go to a modern tech company and I can bet you they would rather die than use VBA.

In terms of VBA vs python.  I automated the generation of 40 separate excel files that used data from a few different sources.  I used python.  It worked just fine and I'm more comfortable with python.  I did later go back and build it out in VBA.  It was a far worse experience for sure but I think was slightly quicker."

I really like the platform and it’s $25/month or (right now) it’s $12.42/month(billed annually), but you have to pay for an entire year ($149.04 for the year).

Play with SQL fiddle and just make up questions to common things people would ask of data, like how many sales in the past month, who did the most, who sold the most value with less stock, etc. Practice practice. Now that you've got answers do quality assurance. Run another SQL asking the same question but using simple pivots in excel etc and see if you get the right answer. Make mistakes. Learn SQL Server in all its facets not just SSMS. SSAS SSIS SSRS etc. Just know how and what they are... Then apply same questions and principles in PowerBI. There is a lot to learn but as a DA myself, I can assure you the magic in your worth is not on how to use these tools, but how to ""tell the story"" and give valuable insights into your company's data that they didn't know existed! That is worth your weight in gold. But just focus on telling the story from the data. Always QA every query even from another colleague of possible. Never ignore anomalies in trend and spikes or troughs. They happened for a reason and you're paid to know why. Good luck. Still bemused they hired you with little SQL knowledge. That's a worry from a hiring perspective but I am sure you'll get the hang of the ropes. Cheers"

But you need a base to hold the tree to hang the ornaments on. And that base is your hypothesis while the tree is your data. If you just start hanging the ornaments on an unsecured tree, you'll just wind up with broken glass on the floor."
yo3lah,ivd94cb,8,"You are not dumb,

Do project as choose a data set you like and do what you said. Why a dataset you like not any? Simply because you will have questions if you are interested in it.

Spend sometime just doing that then learn something new I think you already know excel well enough so learn python and sql. And same process.

I know you want a job, but don't look at what your friend got or has. Do your work you will get paid for your work not his. For what you know, I don't know about your friend but I can see that you need to set your priorities.


This is a personal advice not related to career but take a day where you write what you want e.g get a job, learn something ...etc

Let's say get a job, ok in what industry and for what company. You have some in mind search up what they use excel, power bi tableau python. Ask people who work there (on linkedin) they would be happy to help. And learn it.

You do not care and just want a job to get experience for now search for it check different posts what do they ask for mostly, what do you know and what do you need to learn?  Now you have a path. 

If you know what they mostly ask for you can start applying now."
yo3lah,ivcqdc3,3,"Chances are, you're not dumb. If you're stuck spinning tire and can't think of a project, I recommend getting on YouTube and completing a project alongside one of the Data Analyst YouTubers. Alex the Analyst has project examples. Pick one and do it alongside him. That will open your mind up and help give you ideas on other projects. 

Another thing you could do is think of a question that you want the answer to, and find data about that, clean it, and visualize it. E.g., ""at the current trajectory, how long until the US population is cut in half?"" You can look up births, deaths, replacement rate, etc."
yo3lah,ivcte3y,2,Use kaggle and stratascratch to build initial projects
yo3lah,ivepsio,2,"You missed 4:

Don't put yourself down.

Anyway

1) choose a project. Example. Does the federal interest rate affect voting behaviour? Google federal interest rate 2000 to 2021. Google, election results 2000 to 2021.

2) export the results to Excel, remove header rows, format numbers as numbers, check column names for consistency, sort the results the way you need,  remove columns you don't need, add any helper columns, decide whether to put it all one workbook etc etc.

3) load to your favourite BI tool and start analysing.

Break it into small steps and you'll be fine."
yo3lah,ive314l,1,"Felt the exact same way when I finished the google cert. Had no direction as to how to do the projects. 

It seems like the standard format is to use T’d markdown feature or a jupyter notebook to run a visual template for your project. After that, you post it to your GitHub, Kaggle, or any other public repository for people to see. 

Go trough the steps from the cirt, Ask, Prepare, Process, etc. 

I’d suggest researching how other people did there’s, I was even able to find a few YouTube videos of full walkthroughs of the data sets used in the google cert. it’s important to note that the Bike-Share data set is far more complex than the Women’s Health one because there are thousands of lines of data used for that one so you’re essentially hard stuck on coding out of R for compiling the data. Although it’s not initially stated, the capstone project isn’t meant for you to immediately know exactly what to do, the idea is to present you with a problem and for you to apply what you know about the data analyst process (including how to research for information on how to do things) to it."
yo3lah,ive5tbi,1,If you finished the google certificate then you’ve already done a project
xq3mw8,iq8bgpc,64,"I got a data analyst job from absolute 0. No degree, no office job. I was working as a supervisor at UPS. I just studied my ass off, did the Google Data Certification, built projects and a portfolio, and ruthlessly applied.

The interview was straightforward. An initial interview with a recruiter, then a technical test focused around SQL, and then an interview with the manager who offered me a job at the end of that step.

I think if you study insanely hard, build good projects, and know your stuff, the right company will take a chance on you. My story is by no means the norm though."
xq3mw8,iq7qjpv,13,"Started in advertising and marketing. Learned paid search, then Google analytics. Worked in Digital marketing after that. Then digital strategy. Only after that was I full time analytics and am now head of analytics. Took me 10 years or so"
xq3mw8,iq7svzy,10,"I started by getting a data entry job.  While doing data entry, I managed to learn about SQL, got access to some of the data tables that I was entering into, learned SQL via W3Schools and started querying those tables and eventually using UPDATE statements to do some of my entry work.  Another member of my department was key in helping me develop those skills, as he was in a more data analyst role than data entry.  I also learned some HTML and Javascript skills during that job as well.

I eventually pivoted all that experience into doing digital marketing analytics, which is my career today."
xq3mw8,iq8hkvo,11,"I taught myself data analysis when I was working in marketing. No one else on my team was using the data we had access to, so I took it upon myself to dig in and see what I could figure it. No one asked me to, I was just curious. I did all of my analysis in Excel, and got data out of tools like Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics, and native Facebook, Twitter, YouTube. I tried to answer relevant questions for the team like “what kind of content is the most engaging?” “Where does our website traffic come from?” Etc. I never took a course or certificate. This was years ago when the only options were a college degree in stats or something. Before all the certs existed. 

But my work was enough for me to eventually get moved into a role focused only on marketing analytics. The marketing team I was on was expanding and creating their first dedicated analytics roles. They brought in a manager who did have experience in statistics and marketing analytics. She started teaching me a/b testing and showed me R and my company brought in trainers to teach us Power BI. I thought it was amazing and eventually enrolled in an MS in Data Science because I wanted to learn as much as I could."
xq3mw8,iq890uq,5,Not exactly what you are looking for but I think many converted from something else. This has the benefit having domain knowledge. More than than it give you the chance to reframe your prior (or current experience). I was a Research Analyst. Learned more excel and light SQL on the job. Then I called my self a Reseach (Data) Analyst. Then I started courses. Found a unicorn job that told me I was underpaid and sent me to a boot camp before start the job.
xq3mw8,iq8sa6r,4,"Me, I got my first job only knowing advanced Excel and very rudimentary SQL. My boss was more interested in me because I had domain knowledge."
xq3mw8,iqehgr7,4,I had little to no experience except an economics degree. I self taught myself sql and python and did a couple small portfolio projects in python. I applied to 19 analyst jobs for 5 interviews and 3 offers (withdrew from the other 2 interviews before the cycle ended). It’s definitely doable.

wkxf93,ijpw3xa,71,"Your manager's a dick.

  
You're only one month into a full time job after graduation, of course there's a lot of stuff you don't know! On average, it takes 3-6 months to get settled into a job, even longer when you're new to the workforce or a domain.

  
Look into this [guideline](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/starting-new-job/new-job-guide). Set up a map for yourself and focus on your learning. 

  
Also don't forget to document what you do every week or two, add a few metrics (example-optimized report, decreased run time by 80%). When it's time for you to look for a new role, referring back to this document will really help when updating your resume."
wkxf93,ijqm97e,13,Everyone starts somewhere - I think your manager is passive aggressive and not very well suited to their role. The comments seem unprofessional and emotional - rather than providing constructive feedback and positive reinforcement.
wkxf93,ijrelyw,13,"Unfortunately yes, and also in my first full-time position in data analytics.  I'd previously established and led analytics operations in a small manufacturing company, and was promised during the interview process that this job would only require knowledge of Excel to succeed. Given that I'd created lightweight databases using the IMPORTRANGE and QUERY function in Google Sheets, completed hundreds of unique costing analyses that substantially improved profitability, and was more than comfortable with ""advanced"" functions (LOOKUPs, pivot tables, etc), and was growing increasingly comfortable with cleaning/manipulating data in dplyr I anticipated this role would be well-within my functional capacity.

After starting the job, I quickly learned that the department had no structured onboarding, familiarization, or training program, no historical documentation or readme files, and no SOPs in place.  Further, I discovered that my manager expected me to be familiar with writing my own VBA scripts and R functions and creating automating classification tasks - all of which was never discussed during interviewing and onboarding.  I wasn't offered more than a few minutes of support here and there and never even saw my manager's face on webcam, and after asking for additional support from my lead in the way of mentoring and reviewing my work for constructive feedback, I was informed I wasn't a fit for the organizational culture and was terminated.

I'm a doctoral student studying quantitative research methodologies and carrying a perfect grade point average while working full-time, teaching myself data analytics, and serving as a co-author on published research with the Dean of my college. I have a **very** well-established track record of being capable of quickly learning and bringing myself to a high level of competence, and this organization still wasn't willing to invest any time into my development.

I share all of this to help show that sometimes all you can do is to focus on running your own race while letting the rest roll off of your back.  I heard ""I expected you to know this by now"" more than a few times, and it was shaking my confidence as well.  Not only is it not constructive feedback (the time can simply be spent teaching without the commentary on ""what you should know by now"") but it exposes the department's shortcomings in their recruiting and interviewing processes.  Good departments accurately assess a candidate's experiences and skills relatively to the standard day-to-day tasks required to be successful in a position and helps to prevent being caught off-guard by a candidate's skillset.

Some food for thought that might apply to your situation as well: my manager never quantitatively assessed my skills nor had any rubrics at hand to assess my skills, all despite running an analytics department. Did your manager quantitatively assess you?  If not, you might care to question why they are managing analytics without utilizing analytics through recruiting, interviewing, and onboarding.

I'm sorry to hear that you are experiencing this! Remember that you got the job, and that is something they can never take from you. Use this experience to get paid and learn as much as you can, because sooner or later you'll come across an organization that actually respects and values your **potential** as much as who and what you are as an analyst now, and the extra human care that comes with an organization of that caliber will make a huge difference to your satisfaction at work - which means a ton! Hang in there!"
wkxf93,ijrmk2z,6,"Don't worry, nobody knows what they are doing."
wkxf93,ijqr5of,4,seems like the problem is the manager
wkxf93,ijrhzso,5,"Try to learn as much as you can and try to reach the 6 month mark so you have the experience to put on your resume. Document your progression and contribution for your resume revision and to cover your ass. With a manager like this, please try to limit any verbal conversations & send emails/texts or at least always follow up with an email to confirm what was said verbally. Over time you’ll learn that a job isn’t worth the stress. It’s not safe to be in an environment where you’re not valued or supported."

zsz102,j1c1q4t,3,"Like others have said, you will learn on the job. But if you want to casually get exposure to some topics that might be helpful before you start:

-data warehousing concepts 

-learn a little more about how tableau LODs work and get a better feel for granularity of the data you work with. Maybe also watch a couple videos on using tableau server, creating extracts and schedules and all that. 

But yeah one of the most helpful thing for your job on the technical side will be just becoming familiar with how they handle their data and that really can only happen once you start. Most likely something very generally along the lines of identifying the source systems and their data, the staging areas for the necessary logic/transformation of the data, and where the views or tables used to drive reports in tableau or just general business queries are mainly coming from and seeing the common places (like the source system/staging areas/lookup tables) is being pulled from and being joined to and the join conditions"

Learn Excel, SQL, and Power Bi/Tableau backwards and forwards. **Get a certification in excel and either dash boarding tools.**

I guarantee you no entry level position or even a lot of Data Analyst positions care about Python, pyplot, seaborn, etc. No one wants see a jupyter notebook.

Dataquest just added a power bi and partial tableau course, both which are mediocre and buggy at best.

At this point, it's all about the projects, that's where they can see your skills, and what value you can provide for them.  You may need to apply to more jobs, but the work is out there.  Don't worry about what you don't have, emphasize what you bring to the table right now!

Also, to supplement the Google Course, I also took courses from Udemy on Python Data Analysis (Pandas), advanced SQL and Tableau courses, all for very reasonable investments."
yu65jr,iwad40w,15,"I took the Google course and multiple others and just started an analyst position In the pharma industry that ""required"" a bachelor's or master's. But it's not necessarily a data analyst position. I'll still be doing stuff in excel like cleaning data and taking large sets of sales data and filtering that data and creating calculations based on subsets of that data and things of that nature. But it's moreso solving the same business problem over and over with new data instead of trying to identify trends and creating insights based on those.

Depending on what you're currently doing, a job like this might be a lot better. And if you get a basic position you could use it to automate things in excel and python and all that stuff and get a more advanced position, or get promoted to a SQL developer, or move up in some other way, whereas you're current position may not have the opportunity for that type of thing.

Also, the Google course kind of sucks. You won't learn nearly enough from it. As you take the google course, take these courses:

""Master Microsoft Excel"" learning path on LinkedIn learning (26 hours but you'll learn a lot)
""Complete SQL Mastery"" (I think that's what it's called) on coding with mosh. Take a Tableau course and/or a power BI course. Google teaches R but I'd recommend learning Python, since ultimately without a degree you're not really going to be starting in any positions that require R. Even learning Python is just so you can try to automate things and impress the interviewer with your ambition. 

Also create excel, sql and python projects after you learn each one. You'll learn a lot by doing versus just courses. Then use all that stuff and build a portfolio.

I did have the opportunity to use a little bit of excel and a TINY bit of power bi in my past positions. But I hadn't even finished the Google course, or taken a python course, or even finished my tableau course yet when I got hired.

zm24pz,j099i4g,20,"2 years in now. Coding is probably the best for my undiagnosed ADHD because you get immediate feedback especially with Jupyter notebooks. You go from Point A to Point B

PowerBI is wack and building dashboards no longer appeals to me in the way it did. Just nothing fun about click here then click there etc. There's just way too many moving parts, and if the data isn't that interesting to you, why would you care? 

 Honestly Python/Pandas is the most compelling thing now for me since it is conducive to rote learning and I come from a mathematical background. 

Plus, with ChatGPT, I'm more productive. Obviously, sometimes you'll have to go to Stack Overflow but only like 10-20% of the time right now for me.

EDIT: Also, I've found coming into the office everyday so much better for my productivity. Working from home has slowly turned into a nightmare for me."
zm24pz,j08sd7s,14,"I have ADHD and I am still looking to break into the industry but I've done some work on my own or for school projects before.

What I can say is that when the data means something to you and matters it's much easier to look at and understand without immediately quitting. Looking at numbers is boring because they don't meant anything  to you. But data analysis is about *analysis* - you're trying to come to a conclusion, which means you either have a problem to be solved or a question to be answered. The numbers are answering that question or solving that problem and it's your responsibility to put the two together. To be clear there have been many times where the data has meant nothing to me, it's been hard and I couldn't keep my attention on it - but that's usually because I also can't bring myself to care about the question being asked or problem being solved either. It's top down for me."
zm24pz,j08mfah,31,"I have ADHD and worked as an analyst for a while, but for me personally I had the opposite experience. I found building the dashboards to be the boring part and the query design and coding part to be engaging. 

There are definitely parts of the job that are a struggle with ADHD. Depending on the scope of the project, the executive dysfunction can make it feel overwhelming sometimes.  There will be projects that are basic, or projects that are very tedious compared to the value they provide. I try to balance the tedious and boring projects with engaging ones as much as possible.  I also chose a career path that would increase my chances of doing work that interests me - in this case data engineering.

If you have Excel experience and like the visualization aspect, I recommend getting some experience with Power BI. It has a lot of visualization tools, and it has other tools that can make the data gathering and cleaning parts more tolerable. I know there are companies out there looking for Power BI developers, though I can't speak to the demand. Tableau is similar as well, but has less overlap with Excel."
zm24pz,j08w0py,22,"Data analyst with ADHD here. It works for me because of how I visualise data in my head. I understand how the pieces work together and what I need to do to them to get the desired output that helps the higher ups to make decisions. This scratches that ADHD ""brain itch"" for me. 

In general I think the visualising of findings for the data illiterate is the most important skill to have. Making your output look attractive and accessible is a skill not everybody has. It is also where you will get the most recognition from the higher ups. I always say that my job is turning large volumes of numbers into 2 or 3 PowerPoint slides.

As another commenter mentioned, have a look at Power BI or Tableau for visualisations. And working in Excel still makes you a data analyst, as long as people around you think you are a wizard, you're doing well.

TLDR: if you like data analysis, go for it, enjoying what we do is the best way to Excel with ADHD."
zm24pz,j099lis,7,As a person with ADHD and about to get a bachelor in DA. I do it as much as possible 😂 and I make sure I sit with the things for at least 20 mins and 20 mins turn into an hour and I get obsess and then it somehow not boring anymore because I find something out of it 😂.
zm24pz,j08yyqy,6,"I have ADHD, if I can start coding or analysis I can usually get into a flow state really easily.

Finding a personal project to put in a portfolio was hard at first but I decided to base it around baseball, something I thoroughly enjoy.  In one project I demonstrated my coding ability, my skills in statistics analysis, and simulation. When I'm passionate about  the topic I start to have the questions that data analysis can answer and getting into the project is far less difficult. 

During the project I ran into problems like web-scraping, dealing with strings, storing data, all of which I built functions in different languages to address, and when I was done with the baseball project I refined the functions then posted them as standalone ""projects"" to Kaggle, and my professional github. 

Just think about what you thoroughly enjoy, what keeps you procrastinating the most maybe, and see if you have an organic question when thinking about it and I promise you it makes getting started and keeping with it much much easier. 

My baseball project and its offshoots landed me the best job I've ever had, making great money, doing the kind of work I've wanted to do since high school, just because I wanted to know if the 2020 Dodgers could beat the 1988 Dodgers."
zm24pz,j0a5v4u,6,"Me!! 

I am an analyst and I feel like ADHD can compliment my thinking. Many others in the field think so linear but I get told I’m agile haha 

The hard part was the initial learning for me cause I’m not great at focusing. But if you can get to a decent level of excel / PBI / SQL you can slowly learn other pieces. 

I love that there’s always different puzzles to solve and stories to share. And if you get bored just teach yourself a new skill or do a new analysis. 

Hyper focus is also helpful in doing deep work, if you have that ‘superpower’ and can use it mindfully. 

One cautionary tale it that many analysts are in WFH roles which I know can be challenging for procrastinators, so something to be mindful of when considering roles."
zm24pz,j0abdv8,5,"I was recently-ish diagnosed and have been an analyst for a long time. Yeah, a lot of what I do isn't all that interesting. What I do enjoy is manipulating data outputs in SQL. More recently I've been into automating my excel reports. I've become very good at developing my processes for approaching data problems. There are a million different ways to get to the same conclusion, but over time, I've gotten way more efficient at it and organizing it in a way that I can repeat the process. Next time I do it, I do it faster with fewer steps. This was something I struggled with in the beginning. In a way, I leave myself data breadcrumbs like keeping each step of collecting my data in different worksheets so that when things go wrong, I can backtrack to a step I might have messed up instead of starting over from scratch. (Which I have had to do countless times) I also love feeling like a wizard. Nobody knows what I do or how I do it, but don't make it look too easy or else the work will never end."
zm24pz,j0arfqu,5,"I have ADHD, just completed a master's degree in data analytics and started working as an analyst in the financial services industry.

I loooooove having a job where I get to learn stuff and work on projects all day. Constant dopamine stream from being challenged and solving problems. I take a lot of pride in my work and enjoy making my projects beautiful as well as functional. Maybe you would enjoy focusing on dashboard design and the visualization aspects so you can be the one turning those ""basic-looking spreadsheets"" into something more attractive and practically useful."
zm24pz,j0bp55p,5,"I'm a Data Scientist, and have had very bad inattentive/hyperactive ADHD all my life.  If I'm being honest, way more than the boring stuff like columns and rows and plain looking things, it's the very difficult frustrating things that are what I've had to really learn to deal with.  You get a model working, the output looks great and then a requirement is added that causes you to have to rework it and in a way that is inconsistent with some fundamental of what you originally did.  It gets very frustrating.  And giving estimates on when things are done, when you run into walls, it's very easy to put off dealing with it and boxing yourself into a corner.   


Pro-Tip - don't take your medicine first thing in the morning. Take it after first morning meeting and spend 20 mins doing things that are enjoyable and easy,  You'll get the dopamine increase right around the time that you need it.  Don't take more and more of it when you get frustrated, that just raises anxiety and makes you agitated during an already frustrating time.  


Also remember that consistency is key.  The longer you wait to do something you don't want to do, the more likely you won't do it and if you do, the worse it'll be.  Don't think about the whole project when you get frustrated, just stay focused on the current task and very next task you know you have to do.  As long as you know you know how to do the next task, the frustration stays low.  It's always a spiral of being overwhelmed with frustrating stuff that causes the problems.  


Also, rows and columns aren't going to be what gives you the issues. It's going to be 1000 line R code snippets with no comments and data source connections that don't work with your credentials.  That's the type of stuff that's nightmare fuel."
zkpf2b,j02h0z7,5,"Congrats! Three things that stand out to me compared to many posts I see here from people looking to break in:

1) You already had an undergraduate degree. Subject matter doesn't matter, although I'd wager your Bio degree holds a bit more weight than the average Lib Arts degree, at least to some recruiters/hiring managers. I'd argue this but that's beside the point for now.

2) You got yourself on the job experience via your internship. There's a bit of gatekeeping when internships are only available to active students. But that's the game we're playing. If you don't have this option, job seekers need to find some other way to prove they can play the game--find a way to apply applicable skills to other jobs, or build a portfolio of projects analyzing the plethora of data that's available. 

3) Soft skills seemed like your selling point--both in getting the internship and during your interviews for the job you landed. Having a personal interest in the subject matter central to the job you were applying for probably went a long way--even if you hadn't worked in the banking industry previously, you already knew a lot of the jargon and were able to carry on a conversation about relevant topics with the team. To a certain extent hard skills can be learned (especially at 'entry' level) but being able to talk the talk from day 1 is a big step up over a very technically proficient applicant who doesn't know the first thing about banking (or whatever industry you're applying to). Analysts need to be able to converse regularly with stakeholders and other SMEs in order to do their job. Effective communication skills are just as important, and I'd argue sometimes more important, than hard tech skills."

10dmke6,j4n8wc8,51,"Im a self taught data analyst now working in the industry and this is how I learned SQL and got good at it.

You get good at it on the job sorry this is the truth, Before the job you just need a fundamental grasp of SQL to pass your technical SQL interviews. What's a fundamental grasp you say?

[mode.com/sql-tutorial/](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/) covers every concept/statements an entry level data analyst should know about SQL. If there's anything on there that you have not learned - learn it.

Once you have covered those concepts/statements , the focus should be on getting to the SQL technical interviews part (resume/portfolio, how to apply to jobs to get interviews, tell me about yourself phone screen etc..)

Once you got an interview and heading into the technical part I recommend [interviewquery.com](https://interviewquery.com) or [stratascratch.com](https://stratascratch.com). I practiced as much as I could heading into the interview. Also key tip: I would also use OBS Studio to record my screen when I had technical sql interviews by companies, so I can review afterwards.

Now you have at least 3 values: sha256 hash, filesize and path. The thing is, you can have the same filehash for more files so you need two tables: one to store the file paths and the other to store the hashes with the file size because they will stay constant. The table with the hashes should have a unique index value and the table with the filepaths should contain the ID for the respective table entry containing the filehash for that file.

Now you can find all the dupes on your filesystem. The total entries in your hash list should be <= the total number of filepaths you have.

i4hqvn,g0iguje,6,"Thank you for this thoughtful post! I definitely agree that knowing the lines of business and business processes is fundamental to using the data appropriately. Not everyone on the data side enjoys that side of things, but I think businesses are starting to see how valuable those skills are, in addition to the technical aptitude."
i4hqvn,g0kbaad,3,"Couldn't agree more, it's my main pet peeve with both analysts and organizations in general.

I call those people ""applicationists"" rather than analysts, and it's a problem. Knowing Excel, Tableau, BI tools, web-based reporting tools, etc. is great, but analysis is about analysing the data and drawing actionable conclusions. Just because you can throw some chart together doesn't mean you're doing that."
i4hqvn,g0jhb8l,2,"Totally agree. Pure Data is useless without knowledge, which is quite different from the ~~simple~~ skill of data manipulation"
i4hqvn,g0jq4i8,1,"I completely agree that business understanding is important, but here you are referring to a specific position you are. I come from economics and business background, similar to yours, but work in IT where almost everyone came from software engineering background. I can confidently say, that what additional skills to technical skills you need completely depend on your role.

Few examples:

1. Data analytics is also implementing ML solution into RPA, so a robot could simulate person decisions, where learning aspect is needed. I am not sure how much economics or accounting background would help here, unless the process automated involves econometrics or accounting calculations as part of automation
2. Visual analytics, text analytics,even though it is almost never used at strategic, operational level - Usually implemented as part of product or another technical.

And many other examples....

My point is, that this post seems to be isolated and be referred to someone in the very front of the whole dataflows. And yes, in that case business understanding is much more important than technical understanding. And even though i do believe that being in the front end, with good analytical skills and business knowledge, working at strategical problems and having impact on business decision making is one of the best career paths long term, i still want to emphasize that it is not always the case that business skill is the most important.

I think lots of different people perceive data analytics very differently, without realizing it is a very broad field. Someone works to solve business problems, someone works to improve AI solution for its product and so on."

If you get a job in a data-immature organisation and focus on the low hanging fruit, it is pretty easy to keep your bosses happy with relatively little time investment. Likewise if you work in a data-mature organisation and are just smart about how you scope your work.

That said, if you are only working 2hrs a day, you obviously have a ton of wasted capacity. Things like building relationships with internal stakeholders, automating processes, paying down technical debt, learning new skills and driving new projects are all pretty important to growing your effectiveness. In a lot of roles they take a back seat to meeting the day-to-day deliverables, so I always like to grab the opportunity to do them when I have the time.

z8op1c,iyd9ite,94,"For a data analyst/data scientist, displaying only R or only Python on a resume underlines very clear professional boundaries :

\- Only R : you're a pure statistician/analysis person, usually with an academic background, R is your high tower and you're not going to get your hands dirty in the data infrastructure stuff. Mostly useful if, for example, the company already has a skilled data engineering team, able to perfectly deliver to you, and you're mostly interacting with the stakeholders and management.

\- Only Python : you're able to be closer to the data infrastructure people, exchange code with the data engineers to implement stuff into production. Would be weird to ask a data analyst profile to do some infrastructure stuff, but clearly some ""data scientist"" hires are asked to do that in smaller companies, and it usually involves a lot of Python. Python is also essential in Machine Learning, so even pure academic people need to learn it to go into this area.

Clearly, R is a signal for a pure data analyst & math heavy profile, while Python implies, potentially, more general programming ability and versatility.

If you want to stay in this pure data analyst role, I would say just go for R as it's the right signal and tool for this objective.

But if you want to open some potential new paths for your professional career, for example, if you want to work with data engineering or machine learning at some point, you can't do that without Python. That's why a lot of data people have the capacity to switch between being data analyst, data scientist and data engineer, given a few years. You can't have these trajectories by only sticking to R."
z8op1c,iydmdw8,15,"I'm from software engineering background,  prefers Python. My brother from statistics background prefers R. He says R is packed with statistician friendly libraries.

Python is more popular than R hence why more people talk about it. Just an observation though."
z8op1c,iyemgzv,7,"Python is great and so is R. I suggest learning both. In my opinion, R offers a nicer analysis, visualization, and package development experience than Python. Python is much better for building pipelines, general programming tasks, and interfacing with excel. I use both together rather frequently."
z8op1c,iycjr62,33,"Python is so popular because it is used a lot in data engineering, courtesy of tools like PySpark and Airflow. If an analytics team is going to pick one language, it is generally easier to set yourself up as a Python shop. Just makes it easier to deploy stuff if everyone is working in the same language.

R is probably nicer for most data science-specific tasks though - i.e. munging, analysing and visualising data on your desktop. The tidyverse is a lot more pleasant to work with than pandas etc, and R is very popular with the academic community so it has much better stats packages. Python is perhaps slightly better for ML, but that is a small percentage of most data science work.

Realistically as a data scientist you should be comfortable with both languages, as they are both widely used."
z8op1c,iyeosir,6,"Is Python or R used for visualization outside of academic or research industries?  Ive been working in data for more than 20 years (data analyst, DBA, data engineer, now technical product owner of a data product) in non-academic/research industries: manufacturing and insurance (Fortune 500), my experience is very few people use Python or R for viz, but overwhelmingly, they'll use (or have to use) Power BI or Tableau.

What Ive done over the years is use Python or SQL to prepare or transform data to create data sets to create visualiztions _from_ using Tableau or Power BI.  The primary reason is people generally dont want the hassle to write code to create visualizations when they can just drag n drop (I actually prefer code based viz), and on top of that, it is harder to share amongst a larger team or with organizations throughout the company if your IT doesn't support Python or R deployments (ie server side R Shiny or Python Panel).  In this case, it may make sense to use code to prepare data / ETL, and then a BI tool supported by your IT for visualization.  These large IT enterprisy companies tend to only support Java or C#.  Again, this is what Im seeing and experienced in non-academic / research oriented industries.

However, if you're on a small team or sharing your viz isnt needed or these are just internal viz, then code based viz maybe better AND cheaper than using BI tools.

So its hard to say what ""tool"" you should pursue learning.  It just depends on the company or job description.

EDIT:  Learn R if you're gonna be in field heavily involved with statistics or a company that already has a large user base of R users.  Otherwise, hands down, learn Python as it has far wider use cases and adoption over a wider variety of industries."
z8op1c,iycla38,10,Python is easy to use with a lot of data science libraries and support.  It runs on multiple popular platforms and can be tweaked to be as fast and efficient as you need.
z8op1c,iycpj35,7,"R is very friendly for people who don't have any experience coding and the language was developed from scratch taking data analysis / manipulation into account.

Python got very popular in the data world because the tons of libraries currently available."
z8op1c,iye9kqp,2,"Learn both. Keep nimble 👑.

But seriously, Python is great once you get the hang of it. R is just so easy to pick up. Tidyverse is unparalleled, data table is fast af. Python only beats r with lambdas and non DA/DS use cases imo"
z8op1c,iyf25vl,2,"I think Python is amazing for its ease and flexibility to build out a data analytics project. You can use it to do your proof of concept and build out smaller, full production projects. However for scale and speed you will certainly want to look at different solutions.

Would like to hear what others think and recommended tools to deal with performance and scale."
z8op1c,iykykul,2,"There's a way to do almost everything that Python does in R and a way to do almost everything that R does in Python. Which is ""better"" is a matter of personal preference. 

In terms of which one is better: depends what your co-workers are using, since it's essential to be able to share and quality check code. Fortunately, if you know one and how to program, then picking up the syntax of the other one is relatively straightforward."

Do you see a business as a competition? Because if you do, that's your problem, not management's. Just saying this because I feel you're generalising. 

People knowing more are not necessarily better and should be more rewarded. Even on the same role, you should want different types of people, with different personalities and  backgrounds.

Plus, there's nothing wrong with asking questions. Not saying that's the same as not trying to learn or getting someone to do your job. All I'm saying is that if you laugh at people because they're asking question, the one with an ego problem is you and surely not them. And they are surely learning more than you do. Not saying this applies to your case.

Find a way to show you've applied some of those hard skills in your past jobs, or find a job/internship/volunteer opportunity that allows you to flex those muscles so you can add that. 

Once you find those additions, you've got plenty of filler in the existing experiences section. It's fine to list the positions but most of the tasks you include are not relevant to a DA position. 'Completing tasks requested of me', 'customer service skills', and 'proofreading documents' are pretty low bars and not really worthy of inclusion, at least on a DA resume."

That should help this resume a bunch."
z924d2,iyeztmj,16,"Here is the information I put on my resume:

Note: I take a fairly minimalist approach. However, I try to make sure that the little I have is strong.

**Personal Info:** name,address,phone,email

**Bio:** I write two or three sentences about my professional interest and goals.

**Education/Certifications:** school name, degree, year, and GPA. (I also have my BS in Mathematics). I don't bother with the subjects studied.

**Awards:** Honor's, etc.

**Experience:** (Relevant to the job) Your work experience and the things you have done on the job.

**Skills:** I have my 'Skills' section labels as 'Software' with a list of programming languages and software I am confident in, i.e., if they ask me about it in a interview I can most likely answer it.

**Projects:** I have a list of about 3 self-motivated personal projects I have worked on. I do not have a description of the projects or the language it was written in. The name of the projects gives enough information of what it is supposed to be. They can view my Github for the other details if they are curious.

My Critiques for you:

* Your formatting is a little boring. Change the fonts. Add neutral colors. Perhaps have bullet points instead of sentences.
* Quantifying details are important. Example: 'Introduced and deployed automation techniques, bringing production up 200%.'
* Cut out some of the stuff that is not relevant to the position. You don't need to state 'Learned different skills and responsibilities from supervisor \[ ... \] about what it is like to be a Law Consultant'. That has nothing to do with being a data analyst. It is unwanted filler and the employer doesn't care.
* Do some rewording. You can rewrite 'Proofread important documents before they were sent out' into something a bit more analytical. Make it sounds more complicated and relevant to the position you are applying for.

Other things that helped me:

**Cover letters:** This is the best way to talk about what you can bring to the company. Even if you don't have professional experience in the topic, you can flaunt your knowledge and passion for it. I usually write these with their job posting next to the word document so I can pick out my strongest attributes.

**Website:** This can be a personal website you created from scratch, a website building service, LinkedIn, Github (Personally this is reminding me to update my LinkedIn).

I am currently writing a simple website from scratch in HTML/CSS/Javascript. I feel this is great because I can personalize my website. Not only will it have my professional interest, but also my personal interest. I skateboarded for almost two decades, I can put something on the website about it, because it is MY website. It humanizes you a bit more than a cover letter or resume. I do not want to be a web developer (I don't even have HTML/CSS/JavaScript on my resume). However, if they ask me about the site, it will look good that I took the time to learn something new and difficult.

My Github is probably the online source that helps me the most. I only have like 4 repositories on there, but call backs have gone up since I made it.

I hope this helped out okay. Good luck."
z924d2,iyf8ubo,3,"If you are still working at your Admin Assistant position, I’d recommend working on some side projects that use your skills there. Maybe see if there is a way to use Python to automate some of your daily tasks, run some basic analyses on some of the company data you have access to, change some processes to increase efficiency and run an analysis on how much time and money you saved the company, etc. Then you will have much more meaningful bullet points to put under your experience."

z924d2,iyfzxvp,3,[deleted]
z924d2,iz623pr,3,"So what a lot of people do is try to stuff a resume with everything so that they can be hired for everything. Your resume would improve with being a little more concise.

Your technical skills and industry knowledge are the same thing, but they shouldn't be. Industry knowledge would be like familiarity with Basel 3, FFIEC Reporting, ML for chatbots, etc. I wouldn't put ""Data Entry"" as a skill, just remove it. Also ""Pivot tables"" should be removed, as ""Excel"" covers that.

I think you should remove a few of the technical skills. If you used a few of the tools in class and you took a lot of training on, but there's no way you are proficient in all those things just through classwork. ARC GIS, SPSS, and Matlab are rarely seen, you could drop those and you wouldn't be less employable.

The biggest issue that you really don't have any relevant experience. It's hard to get started, trust me I really, really know. [Dice.com](https://Dice.com), Linkedin, make a list of all temp agencies in your city, make a list of the top 20 employers in your city and check their website once a week. You have to work hard to get your foot in the door, use all these different avenues and you'll have more success."
z924d2,iyhcj2r,2,"Hey OP! It looks like your resume is off to a great start. To make it even better, my main critique would be:   


• The verbs in your resume should be strengthened to success verbs. A success verb is stronger than an active verb - active verbs can be neutral in their depiction of your achievements. Active verbs to avoid include managed, had responsibility for, maintained, hired to, etc. Ideally, a resume bullet point never begins with these. In each case, you want to improve the quality of the bullet by upgrading the verb to a success verb. Words like accelerated, decreased, exceeded, maximized, and optimized help recruiters perceive you as someone who gets things done and creates real, measurable change.

• Your resume should all be written in past tense. This is both for consistency and to help hiring managers perceive you as someone ready to move on to what's next. 

• Your resume is missing a professional summary. In a High Score Resume, the professional summary should communicate what you are seeking — the job you want next. It is not a summary of your past professional experience, but an advertisement to human and ATS readers about where you are headed. In the professional summary, you make your most effective, most concise, most powerful pitch for the job you want. Using short words and brief phrases, this section stands out from the rest of the resume in a dramatic and compelling way. While it should represent only 10% of the space on your resume, the professional summary should be where you spend a third or more of your resume writing time. The best professional summaries include 8-16 phrases spread across two to four lines to serve as an advertisement.

You named it skills and certificates but never named any certificates.  You rename software often (such as Excel) which I'd view as redundant and unorganized.  I don't believe naming your statistical knowledge is beneficial, as what you have listed is an assumed understanding for a data analyst.  I'd be more interested in past model utilization than understanding correlation and significance tests.  Saying you can use R is sufficient enough, you do not need to name you know ggplot2 for visualization - if you went this route you'd need to start naming all the libraries you know for data handling/analysis which isn't reasonable.

tkxeqj,i1ticpg,4,"Georgia State? I have some resources to share if that's your institution!

Additionally:

* Clean up your tenses. You have past tense and present tense verbs for past roles.
* Rework your exec. summary. Your first sentence is in the 3rd person and then you move to 'I' statements. 
* Key word optimization is important for ATS, but your resume has to read well to a real human too! Sprinkle the keywords in throughout your bullet points with examples, rather than all in the exec. summary. 
* I might move skills/certificates to the top and put education at the bottom, especially if you're mentioning your psych degree already in the exec. summary. Skills are more important to see quickly. Format I've always followed is
   * My Information
   * 2 sentences about what I do
   * Skills
   * Job experiences/projects that elaborate on how I use and/or obtained those skills
   * Education
* If you feel the soft skills learned working in a restaurant, office and a retail setting are important to emphasize, move it to the skills section as a single bullet. ""Experience working in fast-paced customer-service settings communicating with diverse populations."" Your current  bullets for retail and restaurant roles are too lengthy and include things that don't feel important. ""Organizing retail displays"" *might* mean that you have good organizational skills and an eye for aesthetics, but what it really says is ""I put things on shelves."" ""Answered the phone"" *might* indicate that you're a good communicator and connector, but what it sounds like is, ""I was a receptionist.""

I want to be an analyst who uses sql and tableu and kibana every day. My company loves me. They think I’m doing great, I show up early, leave late, help others, and take on all kinds of projects. The RFP team at my company actually have asked me to interview for  a position on their team 5 months early (need approval to move upwards with less than a year at the company). I have been applying to a ton of financial analyst positions because I know that I could learn otj and be successful very quickly. I can’t even get an interview for financial analyst positions. I’m not begging for empathy with people, but imagine the imposter syndrome that can build up when people are applying to thousands of jobs they can probably do just fine, and finally get an interview. Someone asks them a sql question (which I’m sure is a heavy part of the job they were going to take on) and they don’t know the answer. I fully understand the frustration on your end, but that person’s current job if they have one is probably 20-30k less than what they are applying for if it was an entry level position.

s2i9w2,hsewdrm,27,"There are a few grammar errors in your ""About"" section that you could fix up. Nothing to be ashamed about but you want to make sure there are absolutely no mistakes on things like your resume and/or github."
s2i9w2,hsezfoi,18,"I am not US-based but I have hired a few data analysts in the UK in the last months. I rarely look at GitHub profiles due to time constraint, especially for first round screenings and neither would our HR department who doesn't know anything about data. This might be different in the US and in larger companies though.   
I do first round screenings based on CV content so I think you might want to start there. Badly formatted CVs or unnecessary long ones are a red flag for me (I once had a 6-page CV from a fresh grad with no experience). Focus on what makes you stand out from the crowd - I guarantee that it will be your marketing exec experience so make sure you clearly articulate how that rounds out your profile. Also make sure your LinkedIn profile aligns with your CV - especially for analysts, I find it highly suspicious if CVs/LinkedIn profiles do no match for key information (happens way too frequently).  
I also truly despise pie charts and donut charts so I do agree with another poster that you might want to consider changing that."
s2i9w2,hsff2n0,18,"> Why getting an entry-level DA job is so hard

Because data analysis isn’t really an entry level job. Being a good data analyst is like being a consultant (even internal roles). It requires having enough business knowledge to not just answer questions but anticipate them or think of questions your stakeholders don’t even think to ask. 

Also because most companies are still really early in their data journeys and doing their first data hires and need people who know how to build data teams. Or maybe they’ve hired 1-2 people but those people are still too swamped trying to “prove” to executives that having a data team is worth it, so even if they hire another person, they don’t have time to mentor/train them. 

A company only has the capacity to hire entry level data roles and mentor/train them if they have a big team. Maybe at least 10-20 experienced people already. And that’s a smaller percentage of companies than people realize.

So you have a small pool of jobs and unfortunately a huge pool of candidates apply because for the past 5-10 years the message has been “data is sexy and there’s tons of demand for talent.” There *is* tons of demand for talent, but for experienced folks with 2-5+ years of experience. 

So what can you do if you can’t land an entry level data role? Broaden your search. Get business skills and domain knowledge through another job. Most folks working in this field started doing someone else, incorporated data analysis in that other role, proven themselves, and then transitioned to a proper data analytics role.

Examples of “something else” among myself and coworkers: marketing, finance, accounting, software dev, research, technical implementation.

You have prior marketing experience, you might have to get a marketing job again and look for opportunities to do data analysis in that role."
s2i9w2,hsf55pk,10,"I would recommend structuring your portfolio more along the lines of a business presentation(meant to solve a problem) and less as an explanation. I briefly looked at it, so I'm not sure what data is available, but with the hotel reviews project you could frame it as something along the lines of ""Ways to Improve Hotel Reviews"". This may not be a perfect match but it's more of an idea of a direction to take it in. 

It's easy to think that the data and analysis speaks for itself but usually breaking it down in the easiest-to-understand way will help. 

Good luck on your search! You look like you have the skills and drive to succeed!"

s2i9w2,hseqog7,7,[deleted]
s2i9w2,hsff1v2,3,I'm in a similar position.
s2i9w2,hsua4ui,2,"Put something in the About section, if you are going to have an about section.  You can include a github link, but don't ask recruiters or interested parties to just go there with no alternative.    

The applied to thousands of companies concerns me.  Applications where possible should be tailored for each potential job.  That takes time.  Others fighting for those jobs are taking that time.

If you have to get a visa sponsorship that creates additional hurdles.  There are some extra costs, but the big hurdles is the uncertainty around the process for a lot of companies that have little to no experience with doing it.    

The market for entry level DA positions is flooded at the moment with people that don't already have 3-5 years of experience.   

The key is networking.  Work the alumni network.  Work cultural networks.   Work any kind of networks you have.  Build new networks.  Try to get people to know you and know you are looking rather than directly approach them for jobs.   

Try to find better information sources on what areas would qualify for your visa.  There's a lot of jobs that could be construed as DA equivalents (or actually are DA but don't have a title that uses that phrase).  Make sure whether it has to be DA related or could be MBA related.  To be honest, I'd think your UT MBA would open more doors to job opportunities than a NTU MS."

srlxs4,hwslmvt,24,"Lots of folks break into data analytics through unrelated degrees/jobs by looking for opportunities to analyze data in their current role. They learn whatever skills will help them in that situation and provide business value through data analysis. This can help springboard to a proper analytics job. 

My story: I previously worked in marketing - mostly content creation and publishing. No one else on my (previous) team was *really* using the data available to make decisions, so I took it upon myself to really dig into it. I learned (mostly on my own) how to dig deeper into the platforms available (Adobe Analytics for web data, various tools for social media data) and mostly used Excel or PowerBI to bring the data together and derive insights which I shared back with the team. Eventually that marketing team grew and analytics roles were created and I got a chance to do analytics full-time. So that was how I broke in. 

However, I quickly realized if I wanted to pursue an analytics career, I would need more advanced skills that my current job wasn’t going to teach me. I went the route of a masters in data science (figured go big or go home plus my company would help with college tuition but not certificates or bootcamps from non-accredited places). What I’ve learned in my masters combined with my job experience helped me land a more advanced analytics role at a tech company. 

But, I could have stayed in that marketing analytics role and done self-study via online classes to learn SQL, Python, basic statistics, etc, and combined with my job experience, I could have used that to move forward, although maybe not to all the same roles and all the same companies.  

For folks who don’t have much work experience, or aren’t in a position to just start doing some data analysis as part of their current role, it’s a lot harder to make the transition, even with these online courses/bootcamps/etc. There *are* a lot of data analytics jobs out there, but the majority want people who already have data analysis experience, even if that wasn’t their job title."

Part of getting a first job in a new field involves understanding which strengths exist in your experience and education to get there. The confidence that comes from this bleeds into your cover letters and interviews.

Education similarly gives you more confidence.

Interviews and decisions to interview are made by humans. Perceptions of confidence, ability, and experience all help in getting you an interview and getting a job. A certification can help improve all 3 of those things (make sure to do a project / build a portfolio - you can demonstrate experience with your application materials, improving odds of an interview).

Edit: all data analytics jobs are not the same. Some businesses are programming shops (R, Python, other) while other businesses use Power BI and Tableau (a lot more forgiving but you still have to learn some amount of programming basics). Most these courses give you resources (like Kaggle) where you can learn some of these skills on your own"

I am pretty sure that I would NOT be able to get the job on the market - my degree is in a quantitative field (economics/econometrics), but it is from a non-US school, and I started as an immigrant with 0 social capital.

uiy1x3,i7fpn8g,11,After skills or even before skills you need a section called portfolio with a hyperlink “click here” to visit my data analyst portfolio.  I get a lot of interviews just off of that section alone.  Show a project in each skill you have listed.  Don’t say something when you can demonstrate and show it.
uiy1x3,i7gjwvw,8,"The technical skills section seems great for getting past HR/auto scanning but it’s really random. Needs better organization.

Pattern recognition is not a technical skill, it’s an analytical skill, unless you used technical tools (which ones?) to do it.

Why is Google analytics ahead of Python and R? (Maybe you’re applying for Google analytics based jobs, fine, but the rest of the CV doesnt have any story on how GA was used for success by you.) 

How much experience do you have with these skills, especially python and R, or other technical tools (measured in years, projects, roles, qualifications, testimonials, something..).

If you’re listing pandas, better also list a few other libraries you know well that are in the common DA stack, and some for R. 

Have a link to some examples.

Your Experience section should clarify and demonstrate your knowledge with the listed technical skills. Use a method like STAR to sharpen these but also make sure to cover how you know these things you claim to know.

VLookUP is not part of GA or python or R or Tableau so maybe it should be listed in technical skills, and instead in the experience demonstrate how you know X skill and what you have done with it, instead of using it to add more skills/keywords.


Lastly, it’s not important what you did unless it’s super relevant (laboratory testing), but what relevant technical or analytical skill you demonstrated proficiency with in the given role. So shorten the internship section and lengthen the others following advice above and in the rest of the thread.

Best of luck!"

uiy1x3,i7h68bl,3,"From a quick skim read, here's my feedback:

Your intro/personal statement is great, but it doesn't say anything about your ambitions, or why you're seeking a change into data analysis.

Like others said, you don't have a LinkedIn or Github link on there - that's pretty much expected.

To me, it's pretty weird that you've put the most recent education, which is the most relevant selling point, at the bottom, and then you don't elaborate on it all. What projects did you complete? What was the work? How was the course structured? What was the curriculum like? These are the type of questions I'm left wondering, and it gives me a feeling of it could have been very basic, but you've completed it and then found it sufficient, even though you know it isn't. I know that a GA course is more than that, but if you're wanting to get a junior data analyst job (I assume?) then you need to explain why you have the relevant knowledge/experience.

Lastly, there's no personality on there (sorry if that's harsh). There are many ways to change this; you can directly list your interests; when elaborating on the GA course, there's scope for highlighting why you chose certain projects(I have no idea how the GA course is structured, but at my bootcamp we could choose a brief within each project); you can do the same with any projects you may have done in your own time.

uiy1x3,i7hdhj0,2,"Your intro, I would condense it as:

Experienced analyst, recently awarded the Google Data Analytic Professional Certificate.

- front end/reporting/visualizations
- scripting/ programming
- data storage (extraction and manipulation)

My stack is Tableau/Excel - C#/VB/VBA - SQL Server/Snowflake/SQLite

At this point learning a new tech from any of those categories is minimal effort because I'm well versed in similar tech. For instance we're moving many of our warehouses to Snowflake and the migration has been really smooth for me, only issues are with migrating my C# WPF apps due to a change in authentication.

Just jump in and have some confidence knowing that if you have those three categories covered with something you will be able to onboard relatively easily regardless of  what the specific company is using. Everything is very similar."
u8yor2,i5ocqua,9,"It's going to be hard to answer that question because not all analysis jobs are the same. There are different requirements based on industry, company, department, level, position, etc. My recommendation for you is to start looking for jobs that you are interested in and if you meet the requirements for them, go ahead and apply. For example if you find a job and they want you to have ""5+ years of experience writing advanced queries"" you're not going to want to apply for one.  


Another thing I see with a lot of these ""I want to transition to data analytics with zero or little experience"" is that they don't realize many of us in this field worked our way into it. Usually you have individuals on the business side that worked their way up into a higher BI role, or you have technical people that knew coding and then worked into BI because they enjoyed the sweet spot between IT and the business side of the house. I know that doesn't cover everyone's story, but I say this to ask that you keep your searches open to titles such as ""Business Analyst"" and perhaps ""Business Intelligence Analyst"" and not just ""Data Analyst""."

11bksbj,j9ykasf,18,"I say the following things regularly:
Well that's shit.
What is that acronym?
Do we need this?
And how am I supposed to do THAT?

But seriously, I'm an analyst and system manager for Workforce Management data/systems in a medium call center. So a lot of forecasting contact volume, planning staffing needs, working with external teams to link systems/fix links, and maintaining system setup. The following are everyday things for me

(1) a lot of finding and cleaning of data. (2) a lot of data management and automation. (3) a lot of translating needs to requirements and results to stories. (4) putting out small fires. (5) learning, panicking, revolving back to ""wait no I'm fucking awesome."""
11bksbj,j9yzhbe,6,"Our department has a long list of ongoing reports that each have their own due date and each analyst is assigned to a batch of them. Then we get special requests from other departments that are added to that list and assigned to an analyst. Then we have a big “for fun” project with one due date and each report in this project is assigned to an analyst. 

So each day starts with the analysts seeing what’s on their plate for the day and then they start sifting through excel sheets, joining them, analyzing, submitting for review, then uploading where it belongs. 

My particular tasks are shadowing coworkers and having them walk me through the steps and editing and formatting the reports on the “fun project.”"
11bksbj,j9zapb5,5,"I'm not a Data Analyst but a Senior Business Analyst, so my focus is slightly different. At my current eCommerce company we are going through a platform transformation including our data warehouse. Within the data area part of our focus is looking at our existing structure, systems, and processes to see if/where we want to modify how we store, classify, or transform our data. I've taken the initiative to help drive our transformation to our new infrastructure (Snowflake) and been working on tickets to help get us there faster (rewriting SQL queries, designing new data models, understanding how other systems within the company will be transformed and how that will effect how we ingest and handle the data.)

Currently I'm working on a ticket to understand and identify ways to improve how we identify and manage ""Bot"" traffic, i.e. any traffic that is unlike a normal human browsing our website. This could include common web crawlers, abnormal traffic from individuals scraping or sending junk requests to us, botnets, etc. This is important because in our line of work, one of the ways we make money is by charging for every click on our website (CPC model) that someone makes to a partner shop. So we (and our partners who pay us for the clicks) are interested in ensuring the traffic they get are from legitimate humans with spending money, among other reasons.  


Unfortunately, less than a handful of people at our company know exactly how the existing bot management system works because the people that wrote the java code left long ago, and although there is documentation, it may not be 100% up to date.  


So I am taking current web session data, reviewing documentation, and combing through the relevant java code as well as talking to the data warehouse team who technically owns the management of that code, to understand and recreate the existing bot detection rules on session data in tableau, getting as close to 100% correct classification with respect to the current system as I can to ensure I understand it. After which I will be analyzing the data to see if there are other patterns of behavior or details about the web sessions themselves that will help us filter out any additional remaining abnormal traffic.

In the end I'll better document the current system, recommend additional criteria for creating a new bot management system (this will become at least another ticket for the data warehouse team to implement in our future infrastructure), and need to coordinate with our B2B team to ensure they understand how we classify bot traffic so they can determine the best way to consume that data to determine which clicks to invalidate, which will also involve coordination with finance so they know which clicks to invoice.

Much of my time lately has been spent heads down working on this ticket, but there are also meetings to help coordinate on other aspects of the transformation,  internal stakeholder requests, or working on brainstorming, experimenting, and gathering insights on other potentials ways to increase revenue, reduce cost, optimize systems, etc."

yselqf,ivyut66,20,"Never query a table without limiting the data via WHERE or LIMIT. The first time you query a new-to-you data source, limit to just today or this week or 100-1000 rows. 

I made the mistake of trying to query a data source that collects millions of rows of data every day without a limit or date range and wondered why after like 20 minutes, it still wasn’t done. 

Also ask about or do some exploration for weird values and ask what they mean. For example, my company has user IDs that are negative. And some dates that are outside of when we started doing business. These are weird edge cases that I typically exclude. 

Also before you query a table, try to talk to a subject matter expert first. I didn’t know for a long time that user IDs don’t always match up between tables due to legacy data sources and sometimes I need to match to the “correct” ID from a completely separate table if I want to join it with something else."

always use transactions

always write alterations as select statements first

yselqf,ivzdit0,6,"If you open a script as ALTER, get into a habit of commenting out the ALTER statement. 

Learn how to use CTEs. These make SQL queries much easier to read. 

Understand the relationships between tables before you join and take note of the number of rows returned from a join. I’ve seen some scripts generate millions of extra rows from a mixed up join. 

Take any opportunity you have to watch someone at your company work through a query. You’ll pickup some shortcuts quickly this way. 

Explore other people’s code when you have time. When you do this, don’t just assume that all the code in production is necessarily good code. Sometimes things work and that’s all you need at that point in time. But it might not be a scalable solution. Maybe it needs a bit of a make over.

Identify the typical naming structure for objects in the database you’re working in and follow suit. If you can’t immediately identify it, ask. 

When it comes to code formatting, figure out if your company uses an external tool to help with code formatting. Example example is RedGate (SQL Prompt?). Personally I just used the Poor SQL Formatter in Azure Data Studio. Using something like this will add a consistent structure to your SQL code, making it a lot easier to read. 

This might just be a SQL Server thing. Use sp_who2 to get a list of your queries that are open. If you write something that stalls out your server or just your own instance, open up a new editor and run that command. Grab the IDs that match your login and run kill [id]. This should free up your instance. 

Business data can be really weird so ask questions!"

Show all the times that someone was admitted to the ICU… we also want readmits but not if they left the ICU within 24 hours. “Oh… and get the attending on entry to the ICU”
I need to know if patients received a glucose test within 30 minutes of us administering xyz… oh… and if it was too high… did we do a retest within five minutes? If so… you can just exclude those
Get the times a patient had an ECG but if they get xyz result… we need to check if they had a retest within 30 minutes
 
If we find out that these things become standard measures… sure… someone can put it into a datamart…. But up to that point… you better be able to write SQL to find and develop it.

Fundamentally, you need to deliver something that fits the request. In a lot of cases, this will not be a dashboard or visualisation. In these cases (which are the VAST majority) a quick SQL pull is *better*. If you are delivering everything as a dashboard, really ask yourself why.

For SQL+PBI, I think this will depend a lot on the state of the source data, and how comfortable you are with DAX. I'm WAY more comfortable with SQL, so doing 99% of the cleaning and transformation with SQL makes more sense to me. If you're really happy doing this visually, more power to you. I also think that the more closely your data resembles a star/snowflake-schema'd clean data warehouse, the more justifiable it is to really skip SQL. I have worked mostly with quite messy production databases, and I can't imagine doing all the work I've had to do to make some reports work in PowerBI."
xpg8tr,iq4n56h,2,"If I have clear requirements I do as much as possible in SQL so dashboards perform as well as possible. However this isn't often, usually my analysis is open ended so I like to do as much as possible in PowerBI because I find it more intuitive.

for anyone starting / junior lvl:

1. work hard on getting that first position, it might take longer than you think. connections and personal recommendations are magic - and portfolio is like sex in marriage  (""*when its good, it 10% of the relashionship - when its bad its 90% of the relationship*"").
2. on your first position: focus on methodology. crunch numbers with abandon, work hard to learn the ins and out of the visualization tools (tableau, pbi, looker etc). focus on mastering the basic SQL-like data manipulations - Joins, Dims and partitions, what is an ETL, how do databases work, window-functions.
3. dont worry about the statistics, calculations, estimates etc. follow the supervisor / seniors in your team, the rest will come naturally

after getting 1-2 years exp:

1. business value is key - smart analytical insights are third place - secondary (and often forgotten) is owning the data your product generates.
2. **business value:** when a ""client"" comes in with a request, practice on how to figure out what they **need**; how will they **use it**; and what will be the **impact**.  
*\[edit: they will often mix it with whatever they think they want, which will be off-key usually\]*
3. when they ask you for vague, poorly defined, or ridiculously complex analyses - that may be annoying as F, but it's your time to shine. find out how you can best serve the person - or the decision-making - with the simplest solution, or the most clear visual report.
4. translate everything you can to either $$ monthy, ## users/customers, or %% retention, for the business. ""*Feature X* *~~yields us an extra 35% clicks~~* *on a whatabaoutbutton... it yields us a rough estimate of 80 - 120$ a day.*""

Second would be to clean the data. You have both boolean and text values in the same column."
ydjfm7,itsvbxh,6,"While the comments related to data cleanup and switching values are helpful, you could do some exploratory analysis with pivot tables to start figuring out what needs to be cleaned and whether or not you have the data to answer the questions you want to answer.

I don't know any links off the top of my head, but googling how to do pivot tables should bring up some helpful tutorials. Off the top of my head, you'll select your columns, and then go under Data--> pivot tables. Although upon second glance it looks like you're using Google Sheets rather than excel, which means I don't remember where that function is. Lol 

Either way, once you have that set up, you can group your responses to the various questions by your columns B or C and then start to see what patterns emerge (if any). 

Doing that exploratory work should be able to point you in the right direction regarding cleanup needed (if any), if you're missing data to answer the questions you want to answer or not, and give you a better idea of how to best visualize the data. 

Hope this helps!!


Edit:: Doing this on mobile, so upon re-reading your questions, realized you were asking how to best switch the responses so they could be analyzed. Derp. Sometimes reading is difficult. Haha 

Replacing with numbers could help. But I'd still start with some exploratory analysis. See how many unique responses there are for each question by taking the answers in each column, copying them to a new column/sheet and removing duplicates. Then determine if any of those answers need to be/can be grouped together or not. From there, decide if it makes more sense to change the answers or not.  Then you can still use pivot tables to see the frequency of each answer, whether you decide to change the answers to numbers, group them, leave them as is, or do something else.

v6iu5n,ibg0hhi,26,Im seeing alot of awesome questions posted on this sub from beginners but not many detailed answers.
v6iu5n,ibgbrta,12,"Came in with a pretty good understanding of Excel and SQL. About a year before I was building things that were helping me in my career. Before that it was a lot of fiddling around trying to figure out how to chart stuff out, search the internet well after errors pop up, etc. Was lucky enough to have a job that needed some automation for moving data from one database to another, so I figured I’d try to crack it. Learned a lot along the way, and it feels exponential now.

The most ideal situation is you have a data project that comes up and you start it in your programming language of choice. 

For python, learn how for loops work through the lens that they can enable you to not have to write the same line of code twice.

When you have to perform any data edits, just start with python or R one of these days. It’ll take a bit before it’s not frustrating, but you’ll learn a lot.

If you perform a manual recurring task on your computer, see if you can figure out how to automate it with Python. File system moving/renaming/etc is easy as hell, and for website interaction Selenium while using Selenium IDE isn’t tough to learn if you’re good at the last tip:

Use Stackoverflow. It’s a godsend."
v6iu5n,ibgnhk8,5,"I first used R five years ago in university. While my understanding of programming logic only improved since then, I often had to relearn common commands after any multi-week hiatus. I’ve used it nearly everyday for the past two years and am only now approaching fluency - meaning that I can plan and implement most if not all tasks quickly, but I still Google syntax for lesser used commands.

I’ve switched to Python recently to start building a new skill. While the logic transfers from R, I am far from “productive” in terms of getting a task done. I am productive in that I’m learning, but I expect to need at least one year of regular use to become fluent.

I studied biology with no formal cs education, but coding for stats courses definitely helped me understand programming more generally.

I strongly recommend learning through projects. Don’t just read the documents; begin building something and constantly go back and forth between your code and the documents. Once you’re familiar with a coding environment you should learn the formatting “rules” that underlie good code. As an aspiring analyst, I would load in some of the native R data (eg. cars) and make various plots with ggplot(). Treat it like a verbal language that you have to practice regularly to retain."
v6iu5n,ibfx0jv,9,"By productive, do you mean in a professional capacity ? i.e. in a job"
v6iu5n,ibi727k,3,"I learned Python and R as part of my MS Data Science program, but I was also working in analytics full-time while in school. 

I would say I wasn’t comfortable using Python on my own until I got through 2 classes - one was an intro to programming and the second was a programming best practices course. Both were taught in Python although neither were specific to just data analysis, but teaching programming. Anyway, both classes were about 30 hours each of in-class lectures plus roughly 100 hours each of working on assignments outside of class. 

R was similar, although we were taught R strictly for data analysis, prediction, statistics. I would say after 1-2 classes, I felt comfortable using it on my own. So ~130-200 hours. 

After the above, I started using Python and R in my analytics job."
v6iu5n,ibgbckt,3,"for python it depends on the course, but ideally 2 hours a day for a month or two to have a good grasp, but if you know other languages and have a reference guide and a good crash course itll be significantly faster"
v6iu5n,ibhmhg9,2,"I use both Python and R. I started with R and after about a year I felt comfortable and started advertising I could use it at work. Before that I was using R for reporting but just didn’t tell anyone while I figured it out. I spent probably 4 years exclusively using R before picking up Python. I predominantly code in Python now. 

A lot at work, none outside of it. I over used R in order to learn it. Even if a report was super basic I made it in R every time. My productivity dropped for a bit for sure, but then increased significantly once I was capable. 

No coding background, I don’t even have a college degree.

I wake up at around 6:45 am by my grandmother’s call after hitting snooze at 6:30. 

I sit still on my bed for a couple of minutes, drink a glass of water and try my best not to look at the notifications on my phone. 

I do my morning prayer. After which I exercise for no more than 15 mins (basic stretching and regular push ups, nothing fancy)

Then it’s time for a quick shower and breakfast before I leave for work around 9 ish. 

Okay, before any of you comes biting my ass, I’ll stop beating around the bush and come straight to the actual question. 

As a data analyst, the better part of my day is spent writing SQL queries fetching data from our database. 

We start our morning with the daily update meeting where everyone (currently the strength is 12, one co-founder and team leads) shares their agenda for the day, what they’ll be working on for that day. That’s the time we prioritise our tasks, discuss dependencies that a team member may have on any other other. 

These are the tools I use ordered in descending order of their usage:

- MySQL
- Metabase
- Google Spreadsheets
- Python (for data wrangling and exploration)

We use metabase as a dashboarding solution for our clients. It has visualisation and scheduling functionalities which serves the purpose. 

I use Python for internal analysis or doing a RCA. 

I get report requirements from all our teams. Some examples include: 

- carry out a RCA (from the tech team),
- creating sales or growth tracking reports (from product team)
- payout reports (from accounts team)

It’s an exciting or a tiring day based on how much progress I’ve made on the task I’m working on. 

It’s an exciting day when my queries work properly and my python code gives me the output I’m expecting to get to the root cause. Also, when I’ve had a good laugh with my favorite colleagues on stupid jokes and sarcastic comments during lunch. 

And it’s a bad day…well, you know when it’s a bad day. 

Also, I’m a low-spirited these days since one of our colleagues left. Our humour level matched, big time. 

Okay, I’ll stop over sharing.

10w2i9f,j7moav5,2,"Besides having good ""technicals"" (meaning you know how to use many formulas, do pivot tables, charts, regression analysis, etc) it also means knowing WHEN AND WHERE to use those ""technicals"" as well (see: what is your methodology in x/y/z situations?).

Anyone can prattle off about the various tools and functions in Excel. A ""strong"" user is one who can talk about HOW they use them.

This is why it is a good idea to put up a few excel projects in Google sheets. It allows you to showcase your work if you are not the best at articulating it."
10w2i9f,j7ktofv,3,"Learn all of it and become a super user. Get a certification on Coursea. Be stronger than others. “Strong” is nice, but you can do way better."
10w2i9f,j7ln29a,1,"In most companies it means PivotTables, vlookup, the IF set of functions (IF/S, SUMIF/S, COUNTIF/S, etc.) For other companies it could include things like INDEX-MATCH or more advanced functions (INDIRERT, etc.), Excel Tables, PowerQuery, VBA, etc. It could include things like Solver, PowerPivot, and other things. But those are typically more rare and dependent on the company."
10tmapj,j78muyn,16,That’s an excellent question. I’ll be following.
10tmapj,j7ajgd9,6,"So I work in a big firm that has contract with the worlds biggest vendors and companies. Mostly in retail or manufacture (eg PepsiCo, Nestle, Microsoft) and also very very small businesses and we are contracted on giving them from 4-12 reports a year about what in their store is selling, how their product is selling compared to other similar products, etc.

We work with maintaining our database, getting data from our retailer that our team puts together to a ""proper"" database.

We work a lot in Excel. And provide the reports there."
10tmapj,j7a5ixc,5,"Depends. Small clients typically just need someone to build dashboard for them in the exact way you described.

I however found out that larger ones put a lot more emphasis on the analysis part of data analysis and will need you to walk them through their dashboard to understand their core goals."
10tmapj,j79emp1,2,Commenting to bump. I would be interested in hearing from someone who’s gone their own way in DA.
10tmapj,j7bee16,1,"You can do consulting. In consulting you have some area of expertise. A business would like to use your expertise. But hiring you for as an employee would be expensive. And they only need your expertise for a small project (e.g. a few months or less.) In this scenario, the client may want to hire you for consulting services. So let's say you get paid a relatively high amount (e.g. $20k+ per month). But this is only guaranteed for lets say 3 months. That's a good deal for the client since they can afford it and is a lot less than they'd be paying you over a year. They also get access to your expertise they otherwise wouldn't get. That isn't necessarily a good deal for you. But it can be if you can get get multiple clients this way. So with one client you only make $60k+ for the year. With two you make $120k+. With four, you make $240k+, etc. So it can become lucrative if your services are in demand and you can get get lots of clients."
10tmapj,j7aqkyo,0,"There isn't one answer, but you monetize it. Either indirectly, by using it to power some other system (zillow), or data sales (processed, analytics / reporting / targeting / benchmarking), or raw (dmp / database)."
10tmapj,j7bp1vs,0,"I am working as a data analyst. Till now worked on more than 5 projects. 
Mainly companies provide their source data connection using which we create a centralised data warehouse where we keep data coming from multiple sources. After this we apply some transformation and then create reports/dashboards.

10f739c,j4vcoq9,6,Hello! I’m graduating from Rutgers in NJ as a business analytics major. I have experience with SQL both academically and professionally. I use python time to time for database management but absolutely love SQL and data visualization (tableau/excel/powerBI). I would love to talk more about the opportunity. I may be under qualified in regards to professional experience but I am passionate to grow and love learning and can confidently say I can impact the team positively. Please let me know!

qkjp88,hixhkky,23,"As much as none. If you know SQL, Excel, and Tableau/Power BI, you can definitely be a competent data analyst without Python or R."
qkjp88,hixdib3,16,"Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn are the primary packages I use. 

Most of what I do in Python:
- read in a CSV
- join data tables 
- clean data, replace values, drop values, create new calculated or categorical columns 
- aggregate data 
- pivot/melt data
- group data and compare 
- check correlations, quartiles, distributions 
- analyze hypothesis tests 
- create visuals to explore the data and/or tell a story 
- answer business problems

Those last two items aren’t as straight forward. Python is a tool. All the packages in Python are tools. If you can use the tools you know to create business value and answer questions for your stakeholders, then you are a competent data analyst."
qkjp88,hiwy11g,13,"This depends on the company, department, and the other tools available. I've seen some roles where scripting was frequent, and others where Python was not touched once. Some were statistics focused with an emphasis on JMP / Analysis for Excel, others were automation focused with an emphasis on Python, Jupyter, Visual Basic, others were dashboarding centric with a focus on SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and still others spent the lion's share of their time doing manual data mining. There are many different types of Data Analysts, so questions about the day-to-day scope of work are integral to ask during the interview process so you know what to brush up on if you receive an offer at that org."
qkjp88,hiyn3tc,2,"You should be familiar with widely used data types, integers (int), floats (float), strings (str), booleans (bool), compound data types (lists, tuples, and dictionaries), loops, functions, and the most important - basic Libraries of Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy).  
And if you know all these, test and practice to improve your skills on stratascratch and hackerrank platform."
qkjp88,hiyzuup,1,"I would love it if I could get my company to use python. So for now, sql, excel, and tableau. 

But to answer your question a different way….python is fun! Think of a fun project that you are interested in and learn. 

Yeah 
Search github for some guidance and start playing."
qkjp88,hiz04bu,1,"I'm a business analyst (reporting and analytics). I live in SQL, Tableau, and Excel. And honestly most of our queries are already setup, so about 99% of what I do is in Tableau and Excel/Google Sheets. I have ventured into Python a couple times for some more complicated analysis, but it's really rare. I'm glad I know it though. *Super* good to have in your toolbox."
qkjp88,hiz16z8,1,"None for me, but my job is more actual BA work than what seems to be traditional DA work as described in this sub."
qkjp88,hiz1oyt,1,"5%? It’s a nice to have but moving the needle is way more important. And you can do that using a variety of tools, none of which need to be Python (not counting pipelining, which you can always use a template for)"
qkjp88,hj4rtwy,1,"As others have said, it depends. In my old job as a Jnr data analyst, SQL, excel and Tableau (in that order of importance) were all that were necessary.

In my new job as a full data analyst in the fintech industry, I am using Python daily, mostly numpy, pandas, seaborn, and some very occasional scikit-learn.

I would say you don't really need any python for some data analyst roles especially if you're just getting into it, but as with most things if you're prepared to learn to code, your options and earning potential will likely grow considerably."
q453b2,hfw4voa,27,Enroll in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I was exactly where you're now 3 months ago.
q453b2,hfwf4ch,17,"In addition to learning SQL, Python, and R, I'd also suggest finding a public dataset on a topic you are really passionate about.  It's a lot easier to understand how the data is organized and what the relationships between the tables are if you are excited about what you can discover from working with it.

As you build your coding skills, figure out how to apply them to your passion dataset.  Use Google to search for extra techniques.

Good luck, and have fun!"

q453b2,hfwumhk,5,"Where are you based?

Check out Keith Galli on YT, he has a couple vids on learning Python, introducing you to Pandas, NumPy and a few viz libraries. Ken Gee/Jee is also pretty good.

Some others mentioned doing the Google DA course, I haven't done it, but I've heard good things about it.

If you do go and complete the course, go ahead and create small data project portfolio (use datasets from Kaggle), it'll will be beneficial to talk about in interviews.

This is essentially what I did but instead of doing the Google course, I did a 3 month placement with a small company - it allowed me to get a Data Analyst apprenticeship at a great company.

Then I guess sky's the limit.

Edit: Oh and I got the placement through Techway Placements, I'm in the UK, I'm not sure if they're available anywhere else, but there should be similar alternatives - if you're outside of the UK of course."
q453b2,hfx8fc5,2,"I took a few courses with “coding with mosh” to be very helpful and the discounts on his courses are really cheap. Very good content with no fluff. I find other courses like google and IBM to be full of fluff with little coding being taught until the very end of the courses. I would start with the Python or SQL course.

myhzz3,gvv2js2,14,Agreed. Word clouds remind of me being a teenager and using Facebook apps to visualise my most used words then sharing them on my wall. 2014 was wild.
myhzz3,gvv3245,6,I would only use them as an opener.
myhzz3,gvv2qnd,9,I don’t have ever seen them used for actual analysis. They are great for pretty visualization though. I would use them for images in reports. Like as a cover or with an introduction.
myhzz3,gvv27ko,9,lmao why would you think this is Unpopular Opinion? Who has convinced you that Data Analysts love word clouds? And who the hell is using a word cloud to show change over time?
myhzz3,gvvi8w5,2,"They aren't designed to be used to show a trend over time.  That is usually going to be a misuse of them.  

Word clouds can work at understanding salience, sometimes relationships of meaning, exposing options, or several other things.  They can also sometimes simply not do much.  It is highly context dependent on the questions asked (both business question and sample questions), the industry context, and the sample.  Word clouds from social media tend to be crap due to issues with all three.   Word clouds should only be used in conjunction with other sources of data to get another angle on the question (or sometimes on the way to get the point across), and then, only for certain types of questions.  When used, they are generally part of a set of data for strategic level questions though there are some product level questions where they can provide some insight into very specific aspects of communications. 

They can be quite useful, but they have to be used and interpreted in the right ways.  They require some sophistication in implementation."
myhzz3,gvvp630,2,"I've never seen someone try to run with a word cloud yet in a professional setting.

I could see them being used in a artsy pamphlet, but they're definitely not much use in a decision making process."
myhzz3,gvz3itl,1,"I built a Natural Language Analysis tool which scraped social media for a large NZ Bank to compare customer opinions comparing them to their competitors.

The main words which came up for their bank were similar to
Shit, cunts, hate, appealing, worst, hate, lazy, fucked, useless

vs Kiwibank which had
easy, good, cheap, happy, new, bad (it wasn't all good but so much better!) 

I had a 2 page spread on the comparisons between the banks.

I also did manual root cause analysis of ""negative and positive emotional sentiment"" and listed off what policies were most hated. 

And had the breakdown of the common issues customers complained online about.

The bank I reviewed only has about 10% positive sentiment, and of those nearly all related to a stadium they sponsored and people happy that their team won. 

I'll be honest, the word cloud for that was a pretty blunt and direct way for me to articulate how much their customers hated them. It summarised around 20k comments about 6 NZ banks into 2 pages.

Having read a ton of the comment extracts, the wordcloud was a quick, messy way to summarise the issue."
zr1lx2,j11gd9k,39,"Oh man I feel this so much. I'm in my first DA job, so obviously I can't speak for anyone but myself, but man this job is not what I thought. I self taught myself the necessary skills to get here, Excel, SQL, Python, Tableau, but when I got hired I quickly realized they only use Excel. They have sheets with rows that go into the millions, sometimes I spend 20 minutes waiting for the sheet not to crash because I fucking scrolled down to fast. All the sheets and/tables/dashboards are made by hand in excel, so I said eff it and taught myself Power Query so I could automate some of it, but even so it runs off excel and takes years to load! 

Then of course they have their in house system that stores all our reports, which I have no clue how it works because nobody I work with has a clue, but naturally whenever I need to download a report it'll take up to an hour. Most of the time I spend working is just manually updating our spread sheets, because of how they have everything set up. As a result the other skills I've taught myself are atrophying, so I've started using my off time to reteach myself to get a better job. 

Sorry for the rant but I read the title and was just happy I wasn't the only one lmao. I guess I can't complain that much since I get paid way better compared to my last job, but man I just thought the job would lean more toward actually analyzing data, or at least automating processes."
zr1lx2,j11j03r,10,"So much of it. But truthfully, I don't think that's uncommon. It's why I think wrangling and cleaning data is by far the most important skill one can have in this role."
zr1lx2,j1243qs,11,This is the reason AI or automation won't take over.
z2mnja,ixhl7e4,21,"Overall, your position is quite good since you mainly use SQL, Excel, and Tableau. My question is what do you want to do exactly in your next phase of your career. 

Do you want to be more technical? Or, do you want to have a managerial role?"
z2mnja,ixh7fbd,10,"Assuming this is $ and in the US? What state? Remote, hybrid, or office based? Are you willing to relocate?"
z2mnja,ixhelff,5,"The only way to find out is to start applying for other roles and see what happens. Yes there are jobs that pay more, but with higher salaries either comes more technical or business sense expectations, ability to manage your own projects and stakeholders, or they expect more experience or an advanced degree. Also higher salary is going to mean more competition and the interviews are tough. I’ve landed interviews with a lot of tech companies (Meta, Google, Spotify, etc) and the interviews are very hard with a low pass rate, most candidates who get through spend a lot of time studying and practice code."
z2mnja,ixi6pug,5,"WTF? 89k?

I'm working 10 years in Ireland and earn 50k euros."
z2mnja,ixju0k6,2,"I would recommend throwing a few applications in, it'll get a better sense of the skills other employers value and if you don't land any offers, hopefully you will know what areas to grow into. 80K is what an entry data analyst makes and 100k is around what a senior data analyst makes at my company and we're a fortune 500 company based out of MI. If your company does any hackathons, I highly recommend participating and trying to learn some python or R, the project you and your team build would be a great topic for job interviews."

wg1m8w,iizebml,9,"In my experience, almost every “data analyst” job involves pretty different day to day tasks.

I find it hilarious, because a lot of people obsess over the differences between data scientists vs analysts va data engineers vs ML engineers vs business analysts vs business intelligence analysts etc etc etc….

When in reality, most companies will interchangeably use those job titles for anybody who might have to download a csv."
wg1m8w,iiy1o5q,9,"I've noticed that many people and even companies don't understand the difference between data engineering and data analysis. So no one should really be surprised when they get a job with one title, but end up doing the job of the other one.   


I don't even know what I'm doing in this thread, since I just got a job as a BI/SQL developer. So to answer your question, no, I am not a data analyst, but I believe they must exist somewhere out there."
wg1m8w,iiywa0f,5,"I joined a company almost six months ago as a data analyst and became the second person in a team of two. My coworker was also called a data analyst but actually dealt with the data engineering while I was being asked for much more data science type work. After a couple of months I did a presentation and explained to all my seniors about how mislabelled our roles were and that the non-technical staff would probably find it easier to understand the skills divide in my team if we were accurately described. I thought it might come across egotistical and self-promotional but they were hugely appreciative of an explanation and they renamed the roles. 

I think a lot of the time we’re hired by people who don’t understand what they’re hiring, sometimes they’ll appreciate a bit of advice from the expert they just hired"

vr3q2r,iesvto9,14,yes absolutely add them
vr3q2r,ietv3pz,9,"I don't think it hurts! But beyond certifications, see if you can make a project with SQL – analyze a dataset on Kaggle, answer some interesting questions with SQL, and put the SQL snippets + results in a GitHub repo. This way, when a hiring manager interviews you, instead of saying ""I know SQL, I have a few certifications"" you can drop a link to the SQL GitHub repo right in the Zoom chat. It really makes an impression, and SHOWS... not tells... but shows you know some SQL!"
vr3q2r,iesws7p,6,"Yes, you should add it. I have some Coursera courses under licences & certificate on LinkedIn and in resume under a headline Courses just as 'SQL' or whatever course you complete."

s9ifrx,htn5rzd,46,"I mean we have a 65 year old lady on our team who spent her whole life in the national park service. Now she works in tableau.

She just spent some time learning the craft before coming here, and she is VERY ALERT, TALENTED, FOCUSED, AND DEDICATED. She's a stronger contributor than others on our team half her age.

This is missing from most people in their 20's. If you can manage to have these qualities, I don't think it matters your age. It's just that what little of these traits people have when they're young, they lose as they age.

If you can break the norm and put in the work you stand a decent chance.

Best of luck"
s9ifrx,htnd4y7,15,"If this is something you truly want to explore, then you should absolutely go after it. I was forty when I decided to go into data science and after two years of busting my ass learning the technical skills, I am now happily in the field. 

Others have already made some good suggestions on skills to focus on, so I won't go into details there. I will say, though, to make use of publicly available data sets to cut your teeth on and build a portfolio (kaggle). And, use visualization tools like Tableau Public to show what you can do with those tool. 

As a hiring manager, experience is certainly important and I would be lying if it weren't an important factor that I consider. That said, I also care very much about passion, curiosity and evidence that someone is a self-starter. I interviewed a gentleman last year for an Analyst role whose only experience was cooking in restaraunts. Reading through his resume, it was apparent that he was between jobs, likely due to COVID. He had spent that free time taking data science and analytics courses online, on his own time, and under his own direction. That earned him an interview. To me, a key skill I look for in an analyst is a desire to learn and explore new things. 

That said, keep your dreams realistic. As I said, I dove into DS when I was 40 years old. There was a lot for me to learn, and there still is a great deal more. When I set my goals, I completely understood that it was unlikely that I would ever end up working on the AlphaGo team, or in an AI division of a big tech firm. My background is in Supply Chain, so I focused my energy on applying analytic skills to that area. It served me quite well in landing a role. With your background, target Data Analyst/ Operations Analyst/ Business Analyst positions. If you put in the effort, you can certainly land one of these roles.

One last piece of advice that I haven't seen in this thread, volunteer. Non-profit organizations  typically have a wealth of data but a lack of budget to be able to hire an analyst. Start volunteering for the local 4H, Main Street Organization or Children's Museum.  As you build your skills, you can offer to provide your analytic services as part of your volunteering efforts. It will help build your portfolio and your network."
s9ifrx,htn7tq9,12,"Do some skill building and then do small projects as a freelancer on Upwork.  That is a low risk way to gain experience without jumping off the deep end. 

Also, parlay your freelance writing into some analytics experience.  There are projects on Upwork that need both write ups and analysis done - I am working on 1 today, in fact. 

Use your skills as leverage...not many analysts have deep writing experience, and it sounds like you might.  That is an advantage for analysis that needs business plans, leader takeaways, etc.  that angle will help you start to build then as you gain pure data skills, you will have multiple skill sets to take advantage of.  

You can do it!"

I had my own cleaning business for a while and cared for my granddaughter full time for a couple of years. I really enjoy working with data and all that goes along with it. I'm doing the Google data analytics course on Coursera and really enjoying it. I think you should give it a try. I realized that when I was 30, 40, 45, etc. I was always thinking I was too old to start something new. Now I look back and think how I was so young and could have done whatever I wanted. Then, LIGHTBULB, I realized that 5 years from now I would feel the exact same way about my position now."

s9ifrx,htnv4h0,6,"I'm realizing that this is an career that rewards sideways entries. Lots of people I know who do non-trivial ""data analysis"" don't have a job title that references that - they're project managers, administrators, technicians, specialists... 

My advice is to not limit yourself to ""data analysis"" roles only. If you think you can do some analysis work with another job title in a field that you like, go for it. You can always highlight your analysis experience in your resume, or perhaps move into a data analysis role in the same organization."
s9ifrx,htq10xq,6,"Don't let hypothetical biases control you nor have too much of your mental real estate. Trust me, you don't want to be your own obstacle alongside real world/external obstacles.

It's about finding what you know that others don't and then turingit in to an edge over others. You have a unique perspective and willingness to try something new. Not every DA position is going to require a bunch of technical skills. Look for ""analyst"" positions in your industry and see how you can translate your skills and knowledge in to those parts they're asking for. You have a rare position so finding a rare job to fit it will be tough but rewarding. None of this stuff is super hard to learn and it's finding how you want to apply it"

s1baye,hs7z84e,-3, If I were you I would design your findings as if you're writing  comic book. Its too long. So your great analysis gets lost.
rd64do,hnzk4sp,18,I really want to hear some answers to this. I use Python all the time for my position but my position is an odd ball data analyst position where I have to beg for things I need. Easier to bang out some code sometimes.
rd64do,hnzls51,14,"I recently went through the application process and landed a job which had python listed as one of the necessary skill set(most job description do). I'm working for couple of months in this new position and haven't wrote a line of code yet. 
With that being said, I'm pretty sure there's a task around the corner that needs me to write few lines of python. 
The way I see it, python is a ""desired"" skill set but not a ""necessary"" skill set like SQL is.

Edit: if your project has datasets in cloud, you most probably end up using python for setting Google Cloud function or AWS Lambda functions for example."
rd64do,ho0fz6o,5,"Requesting python knowledge is understandable - there's just a lot that you can do once you know some basics.  For example, working with APIs is often a lot easier if you know some basic python.

Now ""proficiency"" is probably not needed in most positions, but the problem is almost all job postings are either written up by HR - who usually have NO idea what they're recruiting for or else by hiring managers who really do not put in enough thought into it."
rd64do,hnzs5hf,7,"> By my personal experience, as a Data Analyst, many jobs as well request you to know and master PowerBI, Tableau, Microstrategy or some other tools to end up using Excel 99% of the time. 

I only use SQL + Python/pandas for my job as a Business Analyst. I never touch Excel and would refuse to do so."
rd64do,ho0df23,2,"We do completely bespoke analyses, usually with data sets based on original research.  Rarely is it a time savings for us to use Python.  Most things we do are done in Excel, SPSS or @Risk."
rd64do,ho25mvo,2,Anything that can be done in Excel can be done in notebooks (Python).  When you have two tools that can solve one problem you'll often see people gravitate towards a single tool.
rd64do,hnztn2l,2,"How do you push the datasets you have into a datawarehouse/database etc...?

Which tools are you using to clean datasets?

There's probably many resources that answers my 2 questions, but so does Python, and that's why it is needed in my opinion"
rd64do,ho34rhd,1,"Python is a brilliant Swiss Army Knife. If you’re competent with it, you’re much more useful than someone who can’t code.

The reason it doesn’t get used much in a lot of business analytics teams is because (a) they aren’t doing complicated enough stats to surpass the capacity of Excel/Power BI/whatever, and (b) the IT function doesn’t trust them with sufficient privileges to make use of it in workflow orchestration.

But a lot of analytics teams aspire to developing that capacity, so they look for those skills in new hires"
10jd0xj,j5jqw3z,29,"I learned it this way around. Fundamentally, it depends on what you want. R in and of itself is not bad - it can tick all the boxes functionally, but people don't expect it to. It just isn't very marketable. For a data analytics language, R is great - I tried learning Python/Pandas after R/tidyverse, and it feels painful. 

That being said, SQL, enterprise data vis tools, and a bit of python OR r on the side is what is marketable.

If you are enjoying R right now, go nuts. From a jobs point of view, it isn't as good as python, and you pretty much have to accept that. Getting at least decent at SQL will get you farther in analytics than either of them, and getting some basic experience with Tableau, Power BI, or other enterprise data vis tools will get you even farther.

Ideally, find a project that you enjoy that lets you use R as a kind of 'glue' language - scrape and transform with R, use rmd to do some writeups of your exploratory analysis, and pipe it in to google sheets or some SQL environment, then use something like google data studio to create a dashboard off that.

R is fine. Most companies that want 'python' really just want 'some scripting/data language' rather than specifically python - but there ARE companies that want specifically python, and no companies i've seen that want specifically R."
10jd0xj,j5jy427,11,"Just throwing this out there.

Be careful about the 'code first' mindset. More often than not its the front line tools like Excel that are the more practical solution to things. What can happen if you put code first is that you over-engineer solutions that would be done with less work and more clarity had you chosen a simpler tool. And for now, as your without a job, you need to set up everything yourself. Pick the best tool for the job. Make it easy on yourself and then if you find a need for R, then use it. But think with respect to what is 'needed'. That can help guide you and determine if you're overengineering something that could be done with less work. The tools are there for a reason.

I can relate, I did what you're thinking of with R, but with python. I learned it for years and I still use it, it's a great language, lots of fun. But what ended up happening is I tried to make any task a ""need"" for programming, when in reality tools like Excel would've worked just fine. And now, I'm finally going back and using Excel and i realize that knowing the code side, while it did help with picking up technical tools quick, isn't the same as the excel side. I eventually got comfortable with less clicking, more terminal, more scripting, no gui. That's a different world than that of the software applications used often in this space like Excel, PowerBI, Tableau, MySQL WorkBench, etc. 

For example, what happens if you get to the job and they want you to clean the data in Excel, but you've specialized in R? You're going to have to learn a lot on the spot. You might not have access to R, so its not as easy as just redownloading the language and so on. They have administrators which grant access to certain tools based on your role. See what I'm saying? Since excel is really practical and popular it's a necessary tool for any analyst role. This is the tool that pretty much every person will know or at least be aware of. code is scary to many, even here, people refer to it as ""advanced"". So why stuff a simple problem into an advanced sandbox? Don't.

Just go with the best tool for the job. Think practicality first, rather than code first."
10jd0xj,j5jo4q2,10,"R is great and I also really enjoy. But Excel and SQL are in very high demand, almost a given for most Data Analyst positions, so I would prioritize learning a lot of SQL and Excel.  They also are a lot of fun good luck."
10jd0xj,j5jveq1,5,"I did a similar thing but with Python when I started my path towards DA. I guess I already had a pretty solid base in Excel, but I prioritized Python over SQL. If you enjoy the programming/scripting side of things, go wild! It won't hurt and could prove hugely beneficial in the future. But as others have said I didn't find it beneficial during the job search, especially for entry level roles. Anecdotally, I recall Python showing up in more job descriptions than R.

SQL was by far the most frequently requested skill followed closely by data viz tools (Power BI/Tableau) and Excel. For employability purposes, especially entry level, I'd get comfortable with at least two of those. I essentially landed my job because I spent some time learning Power BI, and I use that plus Excel more than anything else in my day to day."
10jd0xj,j5k1ksc,4,"Imo, Excel is the best beginner DA to learn first. A lot of your work will be converting spreadsheets into tabular format. You can learn dashboard design, ETL whith power query (M language) , database fundamentals (data model),  and DAX which sets you up for power bi. I warn you though you're going to learn to hate spreadsheets. 

SQL should be the next stepping stone just because you can practice it in Excel, access, SQL server and other cloud solutions. 

I feel like R and or python is really meant for analysis data science once you get all the data cleaned and transformed. Or it's used to extract data into your database. Not everyone uses a tools but having the basic coating skills is a very important skill to learn. Really a lot of the things that you learn is fundamentals that can be applied to any tool that's put in front of you."
10jd0xj,j5l8ckc,5,"in business it's excel and sql. python is well rounded, and r is academic"
10jd0xj,j5l5532,1,"So most people who Master's first then work, are usually either Python or R first.  I was a survey analyst PhD bound, so doing ANYTHING in  excel is a BAD BAD BAAAAAADDDD idea. Just way way too much data for excel to reasonably work. So I was an R person.

R works fine if you are federal bound because your bosses will likely be PhDs which many are R experts. The problem is that your projects will be like thesises that suck at data governance, and have a real ego problem. You will be doing projects because you are told to do them with any real context as to why. Generally, if you want a good fed data work, make sure its a company with lots of different people who are adaptable to more than just R.

I would say yes to all the other companies, have fun in R, but learn SQL and Excel, and then move on to Python if you want to write code with people who also do Python."
10jd0xj,j5l5a6k,1,"I'd probably focus more on Excel first, then SQL and a visualization tool of your choice (either tableau or power BI)"
10jd0xj,j5nf9ij,1,You will be using Excel 10x more than you will either SQL or R
10jd0xj,j5ojfx3,1,"Ok guys, thank all so much for your feedback. It's great to hear people actually in the biz tell you how it is. I use Excel at my work now, so I'm checking out some tutorials. I've seen some people recommend the Excel for Business specialization on Coursera, do you guys think it's necessary to do a formal course?

I'm going to keep the R fire going for now and keep learning. Will try and do Excel and R, and eventually incorporate SQL practice."
102ea1c,j2smij9,40,My big question is regarding their data. What data are they giving you? Do they have databases set up for you to query through?
102ea1c,j2smvs7,25,"I've always worked alone.

I'd suggest meeting with them to ask if there are any questions they're looking to answer through data."
102ea1c,j2szp85,11,Id also suggest you also post your question in the data science reddit so you can figure out if this outside the realm of your skillset.
102ea1c,j2t1scz,9,"Getting access to all available databases should be a top priority. Have a long conversation with your manager about why they hired you in the first place and what the impetus was, that should get you some idea of what the expectations are regarding your outputs."
102ea1c,j2tqtmd,6,"You have 90 days, you should formulate a plan of attack. Check out a book called the first 90 days.

Agree with your boss on where you want to be in 90 days. Work backwards to identify what needs to be accomplished to get there. Have regular updates with your boss on your progress, what you found, and the issues you encounter. 

You need to maintain focus and this plan and communication cadence are your tools to ensure you always know what to work on next and explains the impacts to your goals once they start asking you for additional things."
102ea1c,j2ucy45,7,"So this is how one becomes a manager fast or a very experienced DS. 

Not DS but the process is the same read asap: database design for mere mortals. It has a step by step process which has helped me. 

You don't need to conquer Rome in a day so set small easy goals then milestones to a vision. Tbh your vision will change 100 times so don't fall in love with it. 

Under promises and over deliver. Learn, do your best and if you fail alone the way it's just part of it."
102ea1c,j2u07xp,6,Funny how everything is called data nowadays and everyone gets thrown into domains they don't specialize in. This is basically sales & marketing work.
102ea1c,j2v190i,3,"One of the first thing you need to look at, data quality and master data. Fix both (because I suspect there will be problems in thos domain if you are the only data person there) then only you can have good quality analysis.

While doing that, do some projects where you can get quick wins to demonstrate the importance of having you in the company."
102ea1c,j2vs0r4,2,"I'm in this position at the moment and I hope you fare better than I am. They have nothing for me to do and keep forgetting that I even exist. I have to chase my supervisors for tasks and any meeting they need to have with me, they keep forgetting to do it. The only reason Im here is get my experience letter now and my salary then I'm running away to another company. If your company does similar, find a better job please."
102ea1c,j2vgvt7,1,"I dunno maybe it will be tough but I like the idea of starting at the top or alone and then building everything up from scratch to be the best it can be. Just try find out what business questions need answered, if expectations are reasonable  and go from there. You may need to do a lot of educating them, not ideal for everybody"
x1nwv1,imew598,19,"I would suggest any :
Data analyst,
Business Analyst ,
SQL/Database Developer,
ETL Developer,

x1nwv1,imexayy,14,"There is demand for all types of data-related role. Not every company has the same demand for every role, but there are lots of openings for roles as 

- Data Analyst
- Business Analyst 
- Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst or Developer or Engineer
- Tableau or PowerBI or SQL Developer
- Data Engineer 
- Analytics Engineer
- other Analyst (marketing or sales or product or finance etc) 
- Data Scientist (some are more like Data Analyst roles) 

All of these roles use some combination of the skills you listed."
x1nwv1,imeugz4,18,You can apply to any entry-level job now
x1nwv1,img25oj,3,"You got the foundation, you just need to pick a ""speciality"". Working as a DA for a hospital will be different than a DA in a manufacturing firm who will be different than a DA working for a business consultancy, who will all be a bit different than the DAs in the same company but in different departments.
 
Get a list of fields (biomedical research, chemical engineering, accounting, NGO/non-profit) that you like and a bust them down in to a list of 25-30 companies you like and/or interested in. Look at their job posting and apply to 2-3 jobs, one in a department/sector you like. Either way you end up in a field you like, and at a company you're interested in. 
 
Entry-level jobs will be kinda the same across it all. But if you value your title/company/social status that stuff brings, you'll want to start forming a career path. You can end up getting a decent job but doesn't have much of a future, even if you switch companies. Not to mention moving past DA work and on to DS and DE, or doing speciality big data shit for FAANG-level stuff."
wjm7su,ijifq4h,21,"In most cases, it is best to be a ""jack of all trades"" when it comes to ANY field, however, I personally believe that once you start getting enough experience, one should start getting more specialized. This will allow said individual to be more valuable and irreplaceable to a company. Both still apply thought, you are specialized enough that you are the ""keystone"" of your department BUT know enough about broader things, that you can produce insight into other things outside of your specialty. 

&#x200B;

TLDR; Generally, specializing is how you make more money and cement a position, but knowing broader subjects helps avoid tunnel vision."
wjm7su,ijiycym,5,"For Data Analyst you'll need to upskill to progress. At sometime, as an IC, your work will be shared with other teams and those teams may involve Data Scientists and Data Engineers. At this point you'll have to apply more rigor to gain credibility. 

This doesn't mean you have to pivot to those roles. You'll work closely with the more technical roles so it really depends what work you want. Data Science is often trying to measure significance, controlling variables, etc. Data Engineerings will optimize, pipeline, and scale. Data Analysts, in my experience are more business oriented rather than objective or efficiency focused."
wjm7su,ijjkcmv,6,"I personally suggest learning as much as possible! Go into what interest you the most. For me, I love data but I also like that I can save peoples lives through data analysis.

p4tbij,h912k0s,18,"I am doing it right now, coming from a Biology teaching background.

So far, the program seems to be pitched to absolute beginners. I have also read comments in this reddit community saying that it is basic and not to expect to get a job straight after completing it.

To me it provides great background as well as provides context on the soft skills required in a business setting, such as communication and negotiation etc. 
But at a technical level I am looking to other avenues to build up my skills and experience. 

It's one of the reasons why I'm in this reddit community.😊"
p4tbij,h92k6bc,10,I was a high school science teacher and just finished my MS in data analytics from WGU. It is self paced so I spend all my free time on it and finished it in under 4 months. Full price is $4235 (I think) per term (6 months). If you take longer than 6 months you have to pay for another term. They have ‘scholarships’ that you can apply to. I spent one afternoon applying and ended up with 1650 off so I got my masters for 2585. I learned a lot. I just started applying for jobs this week. They help with resumes and I have a 1 on 1 tutorial next week to practice interviewing. I am happy I did it. My mentor was excellent and I loved my course instructors.
p4tbij,h95a4x7,12,Petition to rename this sub r/IsTheGoogleDataAnalysisCertificateWorthIt
p4tbij,h91ewni,8,Be aware that the Google cert uses R while most of industry uses Python. There is an IBM cert that uses Python.
p4tbij,h91kkij,8,I completed the certificate in May. The certificate gave me a good idea of what I need to continue learning if I want to pursue a career in Data Analytics but I did not feel job ready after completing it. Since completing the program I've started to learn Python instead of continuing to learn R.
p4tbij,hnonx33,8,"It will not get you a job. It's better as a supplement to a CS student who wants to add some more stuff to their resume and learn skills to analyze datasets in their spare time for projects for a portfolio.

It's not 100% garbage, just 80% garbage, as it exposes you to alot of stuff, and if you like it you can look on kaggle to do projects. 

So in the end you're better off just torrenting it, and not putting the cert on a resume. Hiring managers will ask why you didn't just go to school for cs, and that's if you get an interview. That's what I experienced twice, back to back after having an interview with a pharmaceutical company and a local tech company. You're just not good enough. I made three capstone projects, a github pages portfolio page, and showed that I knew how to use Sql, python, excel, and r. But not having a degree, and instead having a cert makes me look like I'm an idiot. It's like you don't belong. I'm sure the 50 other companies I applied to either never looked at my resume, or laughed at me. The only reason I even got the interviews with the 2 companies was probably because it was a slow day for them and they had nothing better to do. 

Its humiliating to have to explain why you chose to go to college for x, and now your doing y, and saying you're pivoting to this new exciting career path. They know you're full of shit and you're wasting the ceo and senior analysts time. 

Alot of these courses are simply selling you the American dream of $100k salary, but you will not get a job. Period. The best you will get is permission to be on their LinkedIn to talk to other ""graduates"" and they will all tell you how they haven't found anything either. They're thankful to be exposed to sql and r, but you could have just Googled/YouTube  those skills without having to pay for a coursera paid membership.

Don't trust Youtubers who promote these course, like Tina Huang, Ken Jee, or any of the hundreds of random yet big sub count channels promoting online certs. They are all garbage. Tina Huang in particular annoys me. As she has a thumbnail saying how she got a data scientist job without a CS bachelors... So a way to appeal to the average Joe. But in the video she explains she has a masters in computer science, so yeah, she didn't lie... But she acts like a masters isn't a huge factor to why she got a job in the first place.

As much as millenials hate that bachelors degrees have become the new high school diploma, that's where we are now. College is a need, and so are connections. There are success stories of people being self taught and knowing someone to give them a chance makes them a success story. But think of the hundreds of millions of people who want to be that same success, and how many actually succeed.

Eventually most of these success stories ""quit"" their job, or get fired and make their money making click bait videos on YouTube and having their face plastered on a $5 udemy course saying they can get you job ready. It's all a scam, and people argue which is the best platform to break into the industry, it's the same with anything else. Get proper credentials(4 year degree) , connect to the right people(people who are actually engineers, not recruiters) , and actually be talented (you need to be able to make stuff beyond hangman, like a real fully functional website that you made for a real business on upwork that has a backend).

I hate how the internet has become a place where everyone sells you lies and bullshit. And as an average Joe it makes me feel lesser than these people who chose the right college path. And they mascarade as good samiritans selling snake oil videos that aren't going to do much besides be long drawn out explanations of documentation."
p4tbij,h91bc9t,6,"To add to what's been said, it's a great certificate to get if you're just starting out and want a high-level understanding of the field. It won't be a bargaining chip with employers or an employment guarantee.

It will give you a sense direction on what goes into the role, and you can go from there.

&#x200B;

Goodluck and happy learning!"
p4tbij,h93vuk0,5,"Yes, it's worth learning basics and syntax through this certification but it is not for advanced concepts. So, I'd say that after doing this, you can use resources like mode analytics, datacamp, and stratascratch to learn and practice intermediate and advanced stuff."
p4tbij,h939uhx,5,"To me it is a bit elementary.  I am only about 30% complete, but I was hoping for a more technical focused teaching.  I don’t need to know how to lead a meeting.  I know they are catering to a wide audience, I am just giving my opinion based on professional background."

onftx4,h5rh8zp,9,"Technical skills mean very little if someone can't identify and solve problems correctly. This was the hardest part for me. Focus on taking a research based approach to problem solving and understand the needs of whoever has the problem you're trying to solve.

Once you can handle that the technical aspect becomes important. Excel is still a fantastic tool for analysis and always worth exploring, however I only use it for quick analysis. Assuming you work with databases SQL may be your next priority. Here it's important to understand data modeling/architecture and how to retrieve the data. This is important because you need to know how to access data and how the data all fits together. From there you can start to explore other tools like Python and R. These tools are best for building functions and applications that dig through data and apply statistical methods to the data. They can also create visualizations. You may want to get into Power BI or Tableau before this if you are interested in the visualizations more than the cleansing, processing and statistics part.

Note: Not all of this is required for a beginner. This is just a roadmap in my opinion. I think the most important part is the non-technical side. From there you can dabble in the others and still be a successful data analyst."

You can continue to learn more advanced concepts (r, python, machine learning) as your career continues, but those are basics i would recommend anyone learn since the world literally runs on  spreadsheets and the average shareholder probably doesn’t know the difference between queries in sql and pandas in python.

Demand for talent will continue to grow. We are collecting more data, also, there are a lot of companies still figuring out how to use data. There is tons of data out there that is sorely underutilized. However, data is kind of “overhead” for most companies (we don’t create the product), outside of very big tech companies, most companies keep their data teams smaller than what they are capable of analyzing. 

Additionally, as companies become more “data mature” their demand for new talent will change. When I started my current job, it was enough to know SQL and web analytics and how to analyze a hypothesis test. Now we expect candidates to know that plus Python and predictive modeling. So the expectations from employers are getting more advanced. And given all the masters programs and online courses, they can find candidates with these qualifications. 

But on the flip side, you have companies where using Excel is considered “advanced” and you don’t need as advanced skills to land a job. But at those companies, they’d rather just take an existing employee from another department and have them learn Excel and whatever and give them a job as a data analyst instead of hiring a newbie whose only credential is the Google certificate. 

So, TL,DR: If you have experience and advanced skills, you’ll be fine and will likely not have trouble finding employment for the time being. If you have no experience, it’s going to be hard to break in and you might need to get experience doing something else and then pivot."
z3sms9,ixnhji8,60,"Entry level jobs: almost nonexistent and saturated. 

Experienced roles: nowhere near saturated, which is why pay is so good."
z3sms9,ixnxy4c,16,"I'm a career pivoter. Currently a business analyst but being good with data is one of my strong suits. I'm only 1.5 years in, but I'll say this: similarly to software development, most people's brains are not cut out to excel at this work. I think if you have a knack for it you have little to worry about."
z3sms9,ixndpdr,13,"I would say the saturation isn't representative of an actual supply demand issue. I think there are a lot of bootcamps and online certificate courses pushing the get rich quick scheme and selling a pipe dream. You might see some jobs have over 300 applications, but the real question is, how many of those actually have degrees and are viable candidates for those jobs? Probably far less than half. 


This isn't to say that those without degrees can't break into the field, but they're more than likely going to need a miracle."
z3sms9,ixonwhs,4,"For what it’s worth I’ve seen many Eng switch into DA roles - taking a pay cut for less stress. Competition in this field is probably at an all time high with a lot of resources pushing the field (YT, Certs, etc.,). But for what it’s worth Data is the new gold rush and every company is looking to either work towards a digital transformation or use the data for proper insights."
z3sms9,ixnqcix,13,"I think it is the opposite of saturated in finance, healthcare, tech, and the public sector. There is so much data being captured. Almost every process has moved or is currently being moved to digital and more importantly the cloud. There is an unbelievable amount of data being captured every moment of every day in these fields. Jobs that had nothing to do with programming or statistics are being augmented with analysts to capture better data. These companies are scrambling to develop models to gain insight from the data and they are constantly developing their metrics. Ive seen so much opportunity for elevating the quality of data everywhere Ive worked."
z3sms9,ixpqwt5,3,"I wouldn’t say it’s saturated (I live in France).

First we have to define data Analyst, people tend to call themselves data analyst after taking 1 course of excel which contains SUMIFS and xlookup.

Being data analyst requires hard and soft skills, those are the data analysts who’ll make the 5 or 6 figures.

In reality there are a few of these guys (or girls). For as long as I can remember all « true » data analyst I’ve worked with were mastering their shit and had all quality that you can expect from a data analyst.

Most analytics interviews that have had specific SQL bits for me have been fairly simple - here is a sample schema, describe joins, filtering, grouping, and aggregate functions. A few have asked about LAG and LEAD style window functions or reproducing these with self-joins.

With some that involve more 'engineering' bits I have been asked about query optimisation, data warehouse design, and normalisation. It was clear in the role description that these would be included, though.

For the most part, they are more interested in being able to create the dataset with whatever tool - SQL, Power BI, pretty much take your pick anywhere in the pipeline - than fixating on one tool."

skruom,hvmza68,22,"Really depends on the level. 

Junior/entry level: 
- knows the basics of what the team needs/uses/does. Usually that’s basic stats (took at least one college level course) and SQL (knows joins, case when, difference between where vs having, can aggregate data, etc). 
- ideally has some basic problem solving skills, for example will try looking for a solution on their own when they’re stuck instead of relying on boss/coworkers as the first step to getting unstuck. 
- curious and has a scientific mindset (look for facts and evidence, run tests, etc)
- can communicate clearly when talking about their experience or ideas (you’d be surprised how many struggle with this) 

Experienced/senior: 
- all of the above, plus:
- more advanced skills/experience in the specific things we do, whether that’s SQL or A/B tests or web analytics or building dashboards in Tableau, etc. 
- can manage their own stakeholder relationships without much handholding
- can anticipate business/stakeholder needs before being asked and also fill in the gaps/provide context when given vague tasks 
- comfortable presenting their ideas / explaining their work / training others 
- comes up with their own ideas for projects that support business goals instead of always waiting to be assigned work  
- has at least a few successful projects under their belt that they managed from start to finish that delivered business value (and can clearly explain how) 

Also hiring is crazy right now. There are a lot of open jobs, but everyone wants experienced folks. But experienced folks already have a job, some are not interested in switching jobs right now, and if they are, the potential new employer might not want to pay a high enough salary for someone to be willing to change jobs."
skruom,hvnfbui,4,"Be really good at SQL, then be willing to learn any other necessary languages as you go along.

A lot of the talk around Data Analysis is about being on the cutting edge of Machine Learning and AI. Most companies don't need that. You need to be able to look at a problem, understand the business case for why it needs to be solved and how, and then apply your knowledge to that. The best Data Analysts are pragmatists."
skruom,hvoihm9,3,"My observations from over the years (coming from companies that aren't really data-driven):

Trouble finding a good data analyst may come from the fact that companies that aren't really into data are not willing to pay decent salaries. So when you have a limited budget and need someone experienced, it's a struggle to find ""good"" candidates for your requirements. So I think the label is sometimes less about skills and more about suitability.

On top of what has already been mentioned, the biggest issues I've had with analysts:

\- Lack of QA/error spotting and/or the ability to see issues - focusing too much on the code/methodology and not spending much time checking that a tiny mistake in one line of code completely messes up the data. Mistakes happen but I normally expect them not to be too obvious (all too often they were).

\- Not connecting the analysis back to a business problem: coming from a business angle, I am glad if someone feels great about what they've done but it's very little use to me if I ask the question: how do you expect us to use the results to change our actions and their answer is ""I don't know"". A good analysts will help creating impact. 

\- Not sticking to (realistic) deadlines and/or not being transparent about delays. I had to explain these to some analysts all the time. If the stakeholder needed the data on Wednesday for a meeting, it's no use for them 2 weeks later when they all moved on. Delays are normally obvious in advance - cannot really label a data analyst ""good"" if they decide to communicate it 30 minutes before the deadline after some chasers.

\- On junior levels: entirely unrealistic expectations on how companies work (no, you won't just build a recommender system in 2 weeks that will be put into production on our website because IRL, it might not be that easy).

\- UK experience on more mid-levels: many analysts with a few years of experience seem to lack technical skills, particularly Python/R. Most candidates who do know Python/R have no experience. When you need both, things can get tricky."
skruom,i1wfme1,2,"To find a good data analyst, you need to consider the below traits in a candidate:

1. **Gathering Data Quickly:** As a Data Analyst, you'll be expected to extract data from at least one, if not numerous, platform. Because of the nature of the industry, data sources are constantly changing, and new platforms are continually being developed. To be a great analyst, you must be comfortable pulling data from a platform with which you may have little or no experience and learning from your mistakes. 
2. **Flexible:** Before the report is given to the customer, it's common for numerous persons or committees to provide feedback. While it may be aggravating to go back and slightly alter the Data several times, people advising you have an end goal in mind: to be a productive and useful team member, you must be able to approach each change with a positive attitude. You must accept comments and make improvements without being upset or offended to build a strong connection with your team. 
3. **Attention to Details:** In nearly every career, attention to detail is a desirable attribute, but for data analysts, it is one of the most important. Everyone makes mistakes now and again, but given the type of work an analyst performs, it would be impossible for someone else to identify a mistake before making a business decision based on the analyst's work. Rushing through a task and then producing misleading findings might be disastrous for the company and, eventually, the analyst. Having good attention to detail frequently entails exploring various solutions to an issue rather than falling in love with the first one.
4. **Curiosity:** Curiosity is maybe an essential quality of an exemplary data analyst. While knowledge and technical ability are vital, curiosity in how and why things operate is more. A curious data analyst is most important because they want to learn about the world rather than generate reports, which means they want to uncover truth rather than provide answers."

zmz015,j0e0lri,38,">The thing is that the Data team organization is a bit weird. The DA aren’t really part of the Data team but rather part of the business units (I am a Data Analyst part of the Ops team for example, we got guys in the Marketing, Finance etc)

This itself is not uncommon. They will have DA's in specific departments to deal with specific data. However, I've only ever seen it where they hire experienced analysts depending on the systems they use, who don't require the technical training and can hit the ground running, they would only have to learn the domain a bit.

>I take dozens of requests every time and I just can’t handle everything. It’s a good learning curve, but sometimes I don’t even feel legitimate enough to refuse/challenge their ideas, since the requests come from the management.

So I don't know all the information, but as for general advice. You have to learn how to automate certain processes, this could just involve having an excel template set up all the way up to stored procedures, R code etc. 

Also operate under the assumption that every ""one-time"" request can happen again. As an SOP make everything scalable and reusable.

If you are taking dozens of requests, do everything the easiest possible way. If they are asking for a simple report and it only requires excel to do it, never run through 8 different systems to get the point across unless asked. I see this a lot with junior data analysts who feel the need to use everything for something simple.

Sometimes, you have to discuss with whoever your supervisor to see if all these requests are actually meant for you and should go elsewhere."
zmz015,j0e80s7,14,"Suggest to leadership that they start a PLC (peer learning community) where data analysts from across departments can come a collaborate. If analysts are siloed across the organization, this generally won't happen organically, so you have to be deliberate about putting it into place."
zmz015,j0he2m3,5,"There’s a lot of great advice already posted here which I 100% agree

What I wanted to add to what’s already posted is that what you’re experiencing is very normal. I felt the same as a Jr DA that one of the most difficult parts is managing requests. Questions are cheap- anyone can ask them- as you mature as a DA you learn the skill of helping your stakeholders prioritize those questions (and applying pushback when necessary, when requests are nonsensical, can be answered in a simpler way, or maybe are just unreasonable). However this takes time to develop- I really do sympathize for junior DAs since being able to manage your workflow and requests on top of the tasks themselves is an advanced skill that most people need 1-2 roles/companies to get experience with.

Definitely ask the data team for help! Try to give them a bite size of context “we want to know how many blah blah my approach is to use this table. Does anyone know a better way?”. Create a slack channel or way to have visibility for your questions is possible. That way everything is easy to find and point to later, or re reference if need be. The other DAs on other teams could also be part of that, so you can collaborate more and see others questions. The more you all can learn about the data platform the better, and the better the data platform people understand what you’re trying to do as analysts the better they will be.

For the dozens of requests- you could try having your stakeholders send you requests through a task management tool like Asana (even a google sheet can work). So there’s visibility around all the requests you’ve received- when something new is added to the list make sure to ask them what is most priority or expected timeline. Always try to answer a question the simplest way first- if you’re being asked for a full break down of xyz, ask what they really want to know and try to see if it can be answered a simpler way before spending a whole afternoon on something. A lot of times stakeholders are satisfied with a simpler answer to a question if it frees you up to move onto the next request.

You are doing great! The first DA job is the hardest- you don’t know the industry yet and most companies treat data people like unicorns and have no understanding the complexity of the data. “Oh yes let me just run this query on this perfect table of already formatted data” lol. My first DA job I was a doormat and never pushed back on a single thing, personalized it all that I was a horrible analyst bc I couldn’t answer all their questions- when looking back what they were asking of me was completely unreasonable (they actually expected as a junior DA with no experience I could recreate a complex dashboards they previously paid a vendor 30k a year for, and also be the the sole DA for 3 product managers.)

Just hang in there- try to practice some of the advice posted here but don’t beat yourself up over it. To me being a DA is a dance where you have to practice a lot of things at once, and it just takes time to find your rhythm."
zmz015,j0e9idg,3,"So you don't like talking to the senior data people, but as a junior, the work is overwhelming?

I guarantee if you start to not be able to do your work it will make it's way back to other more senior data people in one way or another. May as well get credit for asking for help when you knew you needed it."
zmz015,j0f33wv,3,"Talk to your boss. Have him or her help you prioritize the requests coming in. It’s not uncommon that they have no clue about your bandwidth or what people are asking for or have zero clue how long something will take to be completed. 

If you’re noticing you’re reaching out for support for specific things (table linkages, data scrubbing, excel) let your boss/manager know you’ve been reaching out to other groups and why and ask for a resource (a dedicated subject matter expert) or training to help you accomplish what you need. 

If your boss is a good one, they will help you feel less overwhelmed and get the resources in place so you can be successful at your job. Best of luck and it will get better. someday you’ll be the person everyone wants to bug for help. And when you do, be kinder to them than those folks who are difficult to interact with."
zmz015,j0edoo9,2,"Who do you report to? I would make sure you’re meeting with them at least weekly to review your tasks/projects and they can help you prioritize your work and also push back on stuff that’s not a priority. A boss’s job is to make sure you are equipped to succeed, remove roadblocks, etc, so don’t feel bad about asking for this type of help. 

Also, what’s the intake process for your work? I would make sure before you agree to anything, you understand 1) how does this support team or company goals and 2) what is the timeline for when they need this completed? This will help when you’re prioritizing your work with your boss."
zmz015,j0fecjn,1,"What do you mean ""dozens of requests every time""? Every week? Every day? If it's a sprint cycle tell us if it's 2 weeks or more.

This is a great question, and this isn't an unusual setup. Companies will usually have an ""Enterprise"" level for Data Engineers, scientists, and other tech positions, and then a corresponding version of that for your LOB/Business Unit. They usually have an Enterprise level to take on specific requests for the entire company, and to help maintain standards through out the company. There may be a Data Engineer team that deploys Oracle databases,  but when your team needs one, there may be an engineer who specifies and coordinates the details of how it's used.

As for how much you work you are getting, the process of determining the level of work you get is called arbitrage, and should be a dedicated task that you and your manager sit down and work through, probably every sprint cycle. Working closely with your manager you can discuss and determine a reasonable time frame for each task, and then decide the most important ones to work on for that cycle.

Also, you should start understanding what tasks are not reasonable to continually being requested. If other departments or teams or even people in your department are getting you to do their work, you should be having hard conversations with you manager on how to push this work back to them. They may genuinely need help, but once you've figured out the issue is, you should document it, meet with that person/team, and walk them through how to do that portion, and it needs to be their responsibility. For example, Sales Department is starting a new system that hooks up to their CRM system, but they need input from Marketing. Marketing ends up dealing with the daily data quality issues, even though Sales is the one who started the whole project. If you are the Data Analyst in Marketing, you and your manager need to push back on Sales to take over that responsibility.

This is assuming your manager is reasonable, they might be knowingly overloading you. In that case, it's bullshit, but you are learning a lot and need more time in your role before you jump ship. But jumping ship is the ultimate solution to a bullshit situation."

I find it hard to judge any job till you spend at least 6 months"

xvwts7,ir3ipso,60,"Your resume isn’t that good. I seriously don’t know how people keep pushing out these resumes when you can easily google things.

Op, I recommend watching YouTube videos on Data Analyst resumes and implementing them to yours. Bullet points could be better as well. But seriously, those videos will explain everything better than I can. 

The projects sound pretty basic as well. Recommend watching videos and reading on doing a more comprehensive project
  
Best of luck."
xvwts7,ir51xue,37,"I got a job with no formal experience, the google analytics course, and a few projects, so I was in a similar position to where you are.

1. I won't belabor the point since others have said it, but you need to beef up your resume. You need to add more keywords, and move that training section down so it's under your projects. Also, if you don't have work experience, then you need to make your projects sound a lot more impressive. Don't put 5 projects with a single line explanation. Try 3 projects but go into depth on them a little. Like 3 bullet points for each explaining how you used ""Data Cleaning"", ""Data Visualization"", ""Data-Driven Decision Making"", etc. Convince the employer you're not just copying tutorial projects, and you actually understand the business process and what kind of insights you're trying to gain from analysis.  

2. Second, how many jobs have you applied to? Because a month is not  long. I applied to almost 200 jobs in my first month of job searching. I was looking at maybe 2-3 calls per 100. It's rough. You gotta be willing to keep applying. I see bootcamp grads with a degree on my LinkedIn still struggling after a few months to get a job. That's the nature of the entry level market right now. So don't let yourself be defeated after a month.  


As a bonus tip, try to find a recruiter. On linkedin or through a company website. A recruiter can help A LOT. It's how I got my first job."
xvwts7,ir3w8hr,19,"Unless you have very freaking great projects in your portfolio, you would need a degree for sure! Your projects are basic, your training are basic. You will need to show them something very unique for them to even consider to look at your whole resume. Otherwise they will just scan for a degree for one second and then move on."
xvwts7,ir6axax,5,"With the experience you have, I’d recommend finding an industry/company that you’re interested in working in, get an entry level position as a receptionist or some sort of administrative role, and try to utilize your data analysis skills to streamline your responsibilities.

xvwts7,ir3orkn,8,"A certification is also not a guarantee for an interview, nor is claiming to know SQL and Tableau. Also do you have a degree?

That certificate is also quite common (I haven’t taken it though lol), it’s more than nothing, but more than likely it won’t substitute for relevant experience. The projects also are quite common every person applying for an entry level job has done a COVID dashboard just like back in 16 everyone had some analysis on the US election. 

It shouldn’t really be this way, but an analyst job (just like most jobs out there nowadays) more than likely requires a college degree. It also shouldn’t be like this, but even entry level jobs require experience nowadays. A person’s experience is what it is, but you need to be able to leverage something or maybe even try to make a “lateral” move in your current place of employment to something more relevant that works with excel etc."

For roles that require hands on experience, this won’t be enough for most mid or large companies with roles focused on DA."
xvwts7,ir7omy3,3,"As a lead data myself, what is essential:

* What can you do?

IMHO, you must show projects, articles, and how you may be a good fit for the job you are trying to get!  


Good luck; you will learn a lot from doing some job interviews: listen and apply every piece of knowledge you have acquired during your certification."

xvwts7,ir75pau,2,"certification without real experience is sometimes more scary than not having it at all, based on my private experience I would go with some freelance platform and solve more and more real problems, in that way You will be constantly learning new tools and using them, it will be a good boost on recruitment talks or even when writing a message or email You can drop some line about interesting problem You have solved recently."
w9eial,ihunxsf,43,"Sort of.  It's more like ""We're trying to figure out why X has gone down?""  And so you present management with data that shows them why, but the why turns out to be their pet project that they like very much and fought very hard for and so they don't like the answer and they do all they can to poke holes in it while another manager actually wants that data so they can throw the pet project manager under the bus and it all turns into a stupid squabble...

But ultimately no one really gets held accountable, especially not you, and everyone forgets about it until next week when some new flavor of the week is all the rage...

But yeah - the money is whole a lot better than my call center days.  And honestly - the drama's higher-class drama than was in the ol' call center. So there's that. :)

In addition to Python (I actually don't even known Python), I'd recommend developing skills in SQL, Excel, Powerpoint and - if you get the opportunity - Tableau.  Google Analytics is good for web analytics specifically - which is a specific form of data analytics but not a generalist skillset.  (It's the form I have a job in - and would recommend - web analytics pays better than general data analytics, but is also harder to get into because fewer jobs.)"
w9eial,ihunj6d,13,"If you are a senior data analyst, or at director level, company may give you vague requests and strategies, and ask you to deliver concrete results. This is unlikely at junior level, which is where you will be.
At junior level, you will most likely be tasked with low level work. Ex: pull data from some places and create certain charts to communicate certain things. Do some Excel reporting. Clean and transform data. Run some basic models under the supervision of more senior people."
w9eial,ihy0w5a,10,"I sit on my ass all day and do like 4 hours of actual work a week

The hardest part of my day is pretending like I’m not doing exactly that when I meet with my boss"
w9eial,ihvlyx5,7,"In my role I have a lot of meetings with stakeholders (usually non-data people) and asking them what their needs are and what they're looking for specifically. That way I can determine what kinds of fields need to be included, what types of metrics we should be looking at, and determining any reporting specifications/requirements the request needs to adhere to. Then once that's done I have to figure out where the data lives and gather it all together.

Once I have the data I need, I spend a good chunk of time cleaning the data and formatting it so that it's actually usable. Then after that's finished, I can actually go ahead and do analyses on the dataset, draw conclusions, write reports, make visualizations, etc. 

Sometimes I will be asked to present  data and findings to leadership, but almost always at a very high level. ""X decreased because Y, X has shown this trend over a set amount of time"" etc. I usually give presentations at department meetings to provide updates on a monthly basis (usually a few slides with charts and bullet points). The presentations are generally pretty brief unless the meeting is specifically focused on the project I worked on. Sometimes the meetings are less formal and it is just presenting my findings over a call to a different team or whatever.

The relationship between my boss is great. I am mostly left to my own devices because I've proven I can complete my work  and ask the right questions. No micromanagement which I appreciate. 

I like my job and what I do. It can be boring at times, but also very rewarding when you see your results come to life in the form of action being taken or discovering new insights that weren't as evident without a deeper dive into the facts. If you're a curious individual, I think the role offers a lot of opportunities and challenges to explore."
w9eial,ihuptr8,7,"There's a lot of: ""Wave your magic data wand this very small subset of the work that I did manually in Excel only took me five minutes, now just do that for 65k times the amount of data!"" Or: ""Just do a select * from [already perfectly cleaned table that doesn't yet exist]"""
w9eial,ihv40oi,8,"The real hard part is that every company is very different. The biggest differences you'll find are tools (Python, R, Excel), data access (limited, open, legacy, cloud), and teams (large, small, internal, external, cross functional).

w9eial,ihws4ix,2,"Different DAs do different things. I do clinical data analysis which is rather repetitive and doesn't have a lot of ""depth"" to it. While the actual work is tedious, the subject matter is interesting. Each report is a bit different and has it's own levels of intensity. Working from SOPs, DTAs, in a research lab with actual scientists, dealing with people from around the world; it has its advantages. I only use Excel but that's mostly due to a lacking in our own internal systems and want of change.
 
Being a DA is company specific. While there's a lot of overlap, being a DA at a manufacturer will be different than a DA for a retail chain, which will be different than an accounting firm, which can be different than a hospital. You're still ""analyzing data"" but the means and whys changing can change a lot of your work flow. A co-worker of mine recently left to be a DA at a major hospital and does less intensive work than I do.
 
Python is more involved in data engineering/science, rather than DA work. Python will help but it's not going to make or break your existence as a DA. If you have more python than data experience, try for more Business (Process) Analyst positions. Those are more geared towards enterprise systems, where the problem youre solving is with the business process itself, not the actions of the business. So automating tasks, changing workflows, those utilize python more than DA work does. 
 
I'd say if youre a DA that uses a lot of python, you're probably the only DA around, or youre apart of a small group. Automation of DA work means death to the DA, more often than not."

w9eial,ihzgk43,1,"It’s creative, yet repetitive. It’s challenging but not hard (unless you are NOT into thinking, then it’s hard).

The hardest bits are completely dependent on your personality and abilities. As an analyst, you look at loads of data, make sense of it, derive insights from it, and share your insights with the organization. That means you need tech skills, math skills, data visualization skills, and communication skills. It’s hard to find anyone who is 10/10 excellent at all the above, but you don’t have to be in most cases (depending how big your team is). I excel at the tech, math, and communication aspect, while my creative side of building a visual to go with these things is a little lacking - I can identify a bad visual just fine, it’s just making one I’m satisfied with takes me longer than other analysts."
zugjm8,j1j213j,32,"SQL is pretty clunky for actual data analysis beyond producing simple summary statistics. It is best leveraged to produce a clean data file that can then be analyzed using other software (e.g., Python, R, etc.). 

So mastering the basics--e.g., SELECT, WHERE/USING, GROUP BY, JOINS, etc.--and learning how to effectively subquery represents the floor. You should also be comfortable with simple functions (e.g., COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, etc.).   

There are diminishing marginal returns to mastering more complex queries, the less common syntax, or analysis beyond basic descriptives. For example, while you can run a simple linear regression in SQL, it is much more efficient to use software designed for that purpose. 

Once you're proficient with the basics of SQL, I'd shift your focus to mastering Python (or R, if so inclined). IMHO, it's much better for a data analyst to have intermediate SQL and advanced Python/R skills than it is to have advanced SQL and intermediate Python/R."

yhf2mi,iue3ky9,5,Great post!
woqsst,ikckymz,61,"I manage a team of data analysts at a large company. These are all my personal takes but maybe they'll be helpful.


Econ is an acceptable major for a data analyst, but it's harder for a first job compared to the math/compsci people because you need to prove you can use computers well. 


Your skills list is filled with a bunch of self guided online courses. While some online courses are great, others are easy and can be finished in a day or so. That's a red flag for me, and most hiring managers I know wouldnt take the time to check the quality of those online courses if there were less risky resumes in the stack. I wouldn't recommend putting online courses you haven't completed yet on the list.


Your project descriptions aren't specific enough to overcome the skepticism the online courses would give me. I'd want to know more about the specific difficulties you encountered in those projects, because as written I don't get a sense of how complex they were. So for example you could be more specific about what steps you needed to take in order to transform and refine that COVID data.


The work experience is also quite vague and has a bunch of lines I wouldn't consider important for an analyst job. You should use that space to talk more about your specific SQL/Excel etc skills."
woqsst,ikcoayj,23,"1. Make it 1 page only
2. use better spacing. Everything is just too messy - borders are too big, weird spacing between sections,  try justifying the lines. This will also make it shorter. 
3. You just graduated and have way too many 3 month stints. Don't try to pad you resume. If something is not relevant, it may be better to exclude that experience. 
4. Quantify your experience. Vague terms like ""monitor business metrics"" mean nothing. What metrics? What numbers can you provide? 

Your resume reads very junior to me which may be why your'e not getting any bites. It might even be worth trying to land more relevant internship experience depending on the companies you have under your belt. Keep in mind you may be competing against people with more experience, relevant degrees, or advanced degrees for some positions. 

Good luck."
woqsst,ikcxyh8,10,"Think like an employer: what will they be looking for?  Put that first. 

So: recent employment in relevant fields with case examples of applied skills. 

Then other employment. 

Then education. 

Basically take what you have and flip the order."
woqsst,ikdfsmt,7,"I don’t know enough about resumes to give better feedback then you already got. But let me just say that “so many job applications and only one interview” is kinda the norm… regardless of your resume.

The last time I was looking for a job, I sent out 127 job applications over the course of 2 months and got 3 interviews and 1 job offer.

It’s a competitive world. 

Keep going."
woqsst,ikh84q8,3,"1. One page only. From the pov of an HR psicologically it will be more tedious to see that the pdf is more than one page.
2. Some design. In canva there are a lot of templates for Cv's, if you are applying to a DA role a 'bored' resume is not the best approach to showcase your skills.
3. The online courses may substract more than they add. Maybe you could just say, experience and advanced level in SQL, or in any skill you have. With this you can delete the clutter and make them focus on the skills you have.
4. The projects that you have done, specially the tableau one, should have a link to Github or tableau itself, with this they can see the quality of visualizations u made. And you already said that you uploaded to tableau so why not posting the link. 
5. Again with the projects, u r not saying anything of value to me with the descriptions, you should make a small summary of the process of developing the project.
E.g. get the data from Kaggle,  upload the data to a db in order to make some transformation and clutter it with sql, next i used python to get special features of the data and get some insights, finally I put the final data with all the transformations and important fields in tableau to make a dashboard."
woqsst,ikff5x7,2,"First off, I must commend you on all of the courses you’ve been taking and the projects you’ve completed so far. 

As others might have said, try to include all of the skills you’ve used at all stages if a particular project. For example, in the employee dashboard project you could briefly outline your process of what skills and programs you used before getting to the tableau step. Where and how did you get the data for this? What programs did you use to collect and clean the data?

Also touch on the benefit. For example who benefitted from the dashboard and why?"
woqsst,ikcmwax,1,"It is a data sheet of I am taking online courses and like bullet points.

It is lacking an objective portion what kind of role are you looking to fill  or what qualities do you bring to a team that cannot be measured. 

Consider starting off instead of education with


Who am I professionally.
What job role am I seeking
Why am I seeking it
What two or three qualities make me a good fit for the role

Consider putting a Techical skills section In a table format. Instead of saying xxx training from ABC

Tech skills

Tableau|Python|SQL
Excel|stuff|thing

Then after education  put the list of certifications.

This gives people a way to see what you are looking for,  quickly scan for key words on tech skills,  then verify those skills latter as certification."

wnu5lu,ik7ctt1,6,"I always ask what does my audience wants or needs to know. You as an a data analyst want to present data and information in a meaningful way that can help your stakeholders make a good business decision. 

From your data, find areas or cities where there are the highest priced listings. Maybe this is a trendy neighborhood, your stakeholders might consider establishing a business there. Like possibly buying a property there or building a coffee shop in walking distance. 

Maybe you can consider the highly rated Airbnb listings. What were the trends or patterns between these listings? Was it the amenities, location, cleanliness or something else. 

When you go through your data, find patterns and outliners and try to figure out what’s causing these or how your stakeholders can capitalize on these patterns. 

Ultimately you need to be able to explain your methodology and able to story tell or walk your audience through the data."

Skills... You have under skills a huge chunk of things. Great okay you have skills. Python jypter notebook pandas numpy excel ... has the basics check.

Core comps... okay... this guy dabbles in everything- this is more of a generic untailored  resume?...

Professional experience... pandas... numpy... didn’t I just read this? How many times does this guy say pandas? Four times lol. What am I going to ask this guy in an interview? Pandas methods? *yawn* Oh... seafood! That’s something... what IS the state of seafood... donations... what were some of the strategies... what was it based off of... okay three exceptional achievement awards?

Here is my resume scan takeaway:

My thought is that I have a couple things to ask this person but I really had to dig for them. My take is you have the right buzzwords but there’s no story or project until you get to the end of your bullet point. And half these bullet points are super vague. 

I’m gonna agree with bigsybiggs and grandmas diapers shorter bulletpoints with more bite. Winning strategies? Like what were the options? Managed data integrity? Was that assigned to you? Was there a reason you needed to do that? Okay I’ll ask him my stock interview questions and maybe he’ll wow me.

10gdnc3,j52aqhw,72,"These are tools used for entirely different things. At every company I’ve worked for, Excel is used to quickly edit and send bits of information / ad-hoc analyses that aren’t meant to last forever.

SQL is used to query from relational databases, and PowerBI is typically used to visualize the data in databases. These tools should work in tandem."
10gdnc3,j52ihov,53,"
You can in some circumstances grab some data, clean, validate write a few formulas and visualise in excel quicker than you could load data into one of the more professional reporting/analytics solutions. It's a Quick win and Yay Happy stakeholders, your manager is happy with your ""get it done"" attitude. 

This is why many business managers love excel. 

Now, Management like your report,  congratulations! every week you are now downloading and preparing this report and before long another  20 - 30 like it.   The data grows over time and you've added a new formula and pages to answer questions, maybe incorporated some new data for comparisons and before long your file(s) are 30 - 40mb and starting to crash randomly. Your quick and easy reports are becoming close to a full time job to update and maintain each week.  You start pushing back on new work requests, your manager is less happy. 

Nobody else in the business knows the ins and outs of your formulas, undocumented data sources and workbook structure so taking leave means the business won't get reports so now you find yourself logging in on your annual leave to refresh some reports. You're less happy. 

The business needs these reports to run, You're now too valuable in your current role to promote and anyway you've not provided anything new or meaningful in quite a while. You're unhappy. 

I've been in analytics 18 years, I've seen this exact scenario in almost every business I've worked. I've even come across some analysts who prefer it, having multiple reports only they know how to maintain and  needing to work on their leave days makes them feel important/valued.  

A proper analytics/reporting solution is scalable, automated, documented and built using best practices that anyone similarly qualified could pick up and run. Once built and running your time can be spent on new requests to help the business. 

This is why a lot of bi/analytics professionals groan about excel."
10gdnc3,j52gdbi,11,Smaller firms or traditional teams with smaller data sets will prefer Excel expertise. Larger departments will use SQL/Power BI because Excel doesn’t scale.
10gdnc3,j540snm,8,"I’m a data analyst. I use Excel, SQL, and Tableau; each for different things. 

Excel is good for quick analyses of small amounts of data. If you have more than 100,000 rows, then the program runs really slowly. 

For large amounts of data, SQL is king. It’s harder to use than Excel because you need to know how to write queries in just the right way. You have to be able to work with your data without actually seeing it. 

Tableau is great for creating dashboards (a dashboard is a collection of key graphs and figures that are easy to read) that can be shared with senior leadership or clients. With tableau, the data can be updated automatically so whenever people view the dashboard, they are seeing the latest data. 

If you’re in undergrad, I would focus on excel skills first. I think companies expect new grads to have excel skills, but SQL or PowerBI/Tableau skills would just be a bonus."
10gdnc3,j5419zo,5,"They are different tools for different kinds of work. Excel is EVERYWHERE. Being good with Excel is just the start. SQL is not everywhere, but still very common. SQL is like the entry level, step 1 of learning to be a data analyst. Like, yeah, Excel is more common, but SQL will get you better jobs with better pay. 

Excel is infinitely flexible, there is no replacement for that. There are other tools that do specific things much better than Excel, but are more limited. I work as a Sr. Data Analyst, doing very well, I'm my own source."
10gdnc3,j54j6nl,4,I've worked for years as a DA. Those tools aren't like each other. You can't do anything in Excel unless you have data. To get data you need SQL. It's absolutely fundamental.
10gdnc3,j54maan,3,"In my experience it's the other way around: almost every analyst knows Excel including BAs and data governance analysts but not every analyst knows SQL, Power BI, Python, Tableau etc. My first couple of DA jobs have been Excel heavy which is why I am finding it hard to move onto more interesting DA roles even though I have had some jobs using some SQL and Power BI."
10gdnc3,j557te5,3,"it depends. you want to scale with your company. so small/medium companies, excel is fine, but not when you deal with very large datasets

but company culture plays a huge role in, if the proper tool is adopted for the right task. excel is ok for smaller analysis, but it starts to suffer pretty fast. for large companies, excel becomes increasingly useless if you are analyzing large datasets; and even small companies if their product is very data heavy. some people/departments flat out refuse to learn sql, and become increasingly frustrated when excel starts getting slow and crashing randomly. 

excel is something pretty much all analysts know, but using it is situational. its like any tool

personally, unless it is a small company, if they only use excel, ill flat out refuse the job unless the pay is pretty sweet. the company is now paying for my frustration, not my productivity."
10gdnc3,j5244xp,6,you might get a better response in r/datascience
10gdnc3,j565mtb,2,"Not seeing gsheets mentioned here but that is what our company relies on in combination with SQL and BI programs. They are very very versatile and we can write data in daily to create interactive user interfaces that everyone can access and already knows how to use. The skills and knowledge for excel should translate to gsheets, however they have more versatility and ability to connect data across them and other cloud based programs"
10a90fi,j44i7qj,4,"I can't search by location, whether or not it's a remote position, and, worst of all, I can't search by language.

yfqwxm,iu4rbve,27,"Glad to see I'm not the only one. I've taken lots of notes and understand while I'm watching, but I do forget a lot. I've always been a better hands on learner so I wish there was more of that."
yfqwxm,iu4wceo,17,"Totally normal. 

In fact, you won’t believe the stuff I still google daily. 

A lot of it depends on the syntax. I find myself constantly googling Power Query M syntax because the keywords they used aren’t intuitive and there isn’t any code complete in Excel."
yfqwxm,iu4u9i9,12,"Everyone learns differently, but I've found that most benefit from learning by doing. If you aren't retaining things then maybe you need to practice as well as do the courses - don't just race through, take some time to experiment with what you are learning, and how it can be applied to datasets outside of the course. 

Find a dataset that interests you (you can find thousands online) and play with it. Ask questions of it and interrogate the data for your answer. You might also use these practice sessions to build a sample portfolio (many recommend it) of your work for when you finish the course."
yfqwxm,iu4qtzv,24,"Yes, normal."
yfqwxm,iu4xcl1,7,That’s normal and I agree that practicing helps a lot more than just … absorbing. Download some free data sets and start applying the things you’re learning. https://datastoryteller.gumroad.com/p/free-datasets-for-analytics-projects
yfqwxm,iu55ldk,7,"Very normal. I've been working in DA for almost 5 years in the military and still lack confidence and surprise myself with the things I do know that others don't, and the simple things I forget that others don't. Take your time learning. If possible, go over the course again after completing it. Don't sell yourself short, and stay confident even when it seems impossible."
yfqwxm,iu6cgvt,7,"This is totally normal response to completely new skills, new paradigms, and a part of the learning process. Much like learning a foreign language, there is the immediate newness of the material, and it must be steadily reinforced with frequent practice.  Even very basic, simple exercises repeating variants of what you just learned will help this process, and you will experience growing sense of familiarity, and recognize patterns of data procedure with steady practice over time.

I've experienced this also, and completed the google course.  I then took Udemy courses on SQL and Tableau, did a lot of repetitive practice with those reinforced lessons, and watched youtube videos for Excel types of procedures, like cleaning data, using formulas, learning about vlookup, xlookup and of course pivot tables.

Don't be discouraged, just stick at it and keep doing a little everyday, or at least as frequently as possible, especially in the beginning.  Good luck!"
yfqwxm,iu5enov,5,I hope it's normal. I'm starting course 7. I still review my note and play around with sql and excel just to try and maintain something.
yfqwxm,iu5fo7s,5,"Yes, very normal. Once you get a job and begin implementing these skills they will become second nature.

The course gave me enough knowledge to talk the lingo and how to open up the programs.

Thats all you need to get hired as a junior data analyst, as long as you are willing to learn."

sdblwv,huc4gn3,67,"I'll throw in my two cents here as someone who is currently hiring for data analysts and looks through all the resumes. 

  
A degree or a few years of experience only checks off a ""basic qualifications"" box. A google certificate doesn't even do that. So unfortunately I would never extend an interview to someone who just had the certificate on their resume.

  
But I'm willing to overlook that if people SHOW me what they can do.

  
When I skim through a resume, I want to be able to have an idea of the type of work you've done and what impact you have made with your work. If you're confused on how to write about projects, I'd suggest the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to summarize your work in 1-2 sentences. 

So please put on your resume the projects you did for your certificate, any personal projects, or if you don't have any projects, there are a lot of volunteer opportunities out there that have scoped out projects that need to be picked up."
sdblwv,hubmbqi,22,Do some personal projects & add em to GitHub so you can include the link in your resume
sdblwv,hubycyt,13,"What other qualifications do you have? Any other degrees or work experience? Any projects? 

People with BS degrees in statistics and computer science also struggle to land jobs and that’s your competition. If all you have is a certificate, unfortunately that’s not a strong enough signal to recruiters/employers that you can do the job, so they’re going to spend their time interviewing folks with degrees, internships, experience. 

Also, how is your network? Entry level roles are flooded with applications, the reality is lots of resumes never even get looked at. Having a referral from someone in your network can help at least get your resume looked at."
sdblwv,hudtrvo,7,"You need to find projects to show off your skills/knowledge and be ready to talk about them in depth in an interview, a portfolio can give them a lot more confident in your skills

I always like to compare it to artists. If you went to an interview for a concept artist and told them you totally can draw super well and you took an online class about it, they don’t really have much confidence you actually know it, especially if other people are coming in from art schools where they’ve likely hired out of in the past. How would you get past that? Literally come in with some awesome drawings you made, it’ll clearly state your skills better than any degree/certificate ever could

Just like that, don’t just promise them you totally could do data analysis stuff, come in with a portfolio of projects to SHOW them you can do it

Uploading to GitHub and including a link to it on your resume/LinkedIn would be great since they could view your work before scheduling an interview, otherwise it wouldn’t be too helpful for getting an interview in the first place."
sdblwv,hudncws,6,"Now to showcase your skills to your interviewers or employers, do some interesting projects on Kaggle platform. And to practice interview questions I recommend using stratascratch platform. It'll also help you learn advanced concepts and how to solve hard problems in data analytics."
sdblwv,hud3xt9,4,I finished the Google Data Analytics certificate to and it doesn't guarantee a interview let alone a job. I'm struggling with the same thing. Your best bet is to start a portfolio. Also try to update your resume to include any analytical tasks you do in your current job.
sdblwv,hudplbp,4,"Projects - maybe 2 for each big skill set you have. You might get a simple website for displaying and linking to them, or just use Github."
sdblwv,hubq85t,3,Also check out blind and ask for referrals there.
sdblwv,hue0g5s,5,"Could you post your resume? Maybe it needs a critique/roast. Also you could try not typing in ""data analyst jobs"" and try another query. That keyword is super saturated with resumes. Just looking on LinkedIn I'm seeing some jobs under ""Data Analyst"" getting 500+ resumes which is insane.  Way too many people out there calling themselves data analysts. Try another related term like ""Financial Analyst"" or ""Junior Data Scientist"" or ""Researcher"".

We need more nurses, software engineers and a lot of other jobs are going unfilled. Yet, people are piling into DA.

Anyways that's my two cents"
sdblwv,hubx6jn,13,"My God. I wonder how common this is? People taking random courses and then thinking someone will give them a job. This honestly makes me hate certain companies.

I took the Google course and it is a great introduction, but it does not give any tangible benefits, and honestly you could have learned everything on the course on your own. 

Just take a job involving data. Any job. Even boring ass data entry. That will give you more job skills than any course will."

r5hk2o,hmnhc5s,3,The design of the blog is impeccable. I liked your take on it. I hope managers who are wondering about the certificate find it.
r5hk2o,hmrm7uv,1,"Interesting. I took the certificate a couple of weeks ago (finished it all in an afternoon). I see myself as a beginner but have some basic knowledge so I decided to start by taking the tests until I get stuck and start learning from there, but besides the half an hour I dedicated to R, I just passed everything. I'm highly doubtful that something so easy to complete by someone without any data background would impress anyone. 

I do have in on my resume because why not, so I'm glad to hear at least one hiring manager sees value in it."
otun9m,h6xz8dl,19,"Just take any entry-level job. Even if it is data-entry. You are going to learn more about data science just putting stuff into an operating system then you ever would from courses.

Also, please don’t take this the wrong way, but please stop putting so much emphasis on courses. They are helpful, but a hiring manager is going to be more concerned with what you can do, then how many courses you have taken. Also, courses are just going to teach you the bare min. and not teach you how to think critically. You need to get out of this idea that taking courses is going to magically uproot your life.

Your skillset is fine, but a lot of it is not necessary. Excel is and will continue to be the medium that most data is analyzed and shared with. Especially since software like sql and python is stupid expensive and you actually need to train on those platforms and the average stakeholder is not going care what pandas you used to clean something up with. They are going to care about if they can understand what your analysis says and if they can easily distribute it. Once your career advances, you can learn more advanced skills like python and sql.

I am not sure where you got this idea that data-entry is being automated? There will always be a need for a person to think critically about what is being entered into an operating system/spreadsheet. Stop doubting yourself. Data science is a growing field and anyone can get into to. I know it seems daunting because people are throwing big words and big degrees at you, but that is because data science is new and trending right now and most people don’t really understand what it is. 

I am not aware of any hiring manager that was impressed by a portfolio. Every hiring manager I have had was more impressed with what I could do and what solutions I could bring to his team.

Good luck!"
otun9m,h6zw2um,12,"History undergrad to data analyst here.

Learn and create projects in this order. Then put them on github. Then put a reference to your github page on your resume.
1. SQL - to query data
2. Tableau or Power BI - to explore and visualize the data
3. Python - to work the data

Check out “Alex the Analyst” on YouTube.

Also check classes at your local Junior college. Lots of JuCo’s offer certificates and provide a deeper (and slower) learning experience than bootcamps. This was very helpful for me.

This took me 2 - 3 years to do and I’m still working at it."
otun9m,h6ytcdu,11,"I got into analytics with a non-CS, non math heavy degree. The two things that got me the job were:
1. A clean, clear resume with a few specific examples of the data work i had done (dashboards, modeling)
2. My people skills. I had a clear background of working with customers (internal and external) and that was what clearly set me apart. There are a million tech centric degree holders, but very few people with demonstrated interpersonal skills. If you can convince people of your technical sufficiency, lean heavily on your communication skills, and an entry level position is very achievable."

Your top priority is SQL. Finish SQL courses and start applying.

You're right that it's not as coding-heavy as a developer job.  It's really a mix of coding, SQL, math, and Excel skills.

The Google DA Certificate is good, but you'll really want to have a data analysis project you can show off to potential employers.  Something that uses all four of those skills you mentioned.

11174xj,j8d8t75,45,"For me, I spent years in your position. And there is no 1 way of resolving that.

Think of it this way... a lot of top chefs at the start of their career are just learning the techniques and can only put together basic recipes that are taught to them. Only after years and years can they then design not only recipes but full menus. There is no test or marginal point, it just happens over time through repetition and exposure to more and more projects (and critically, more experienced and competent analysts).

Right now, just get really good at what your doing and then go back to the basics of...

What does the data show? Does it show anything of value? If not, sometimes that is OK, and that is the only answer. That there is nothing significant to report. 

A simple trick/practice worked for me. Try creating a 1 page slide of your findings. This process forces you to distill all the data into a couple minutes of insight using only the most useful charts/tables/graphs. When creating this slide, always be thinking of a would-be viewer/recipient who is critically assessing you with a ""so what?"".

Sometimes when you feel like there is nothing to report on the data in isolation, consider how this compares to similar data sets (I'm thinking, as an example about marketing campaign results here).

I hope some of that may be of use.

P.S. I felt like a f***ing idiot/charlatan for years"

11174xj,j8ekp35,1,"What I have found is it's really helpful to have one or two narrow ""findings"" with some type of recommendation. Most requests for analysis come to me not very well defined, if at all possible I will spend as much time as I can get with the requester or stakeholders so they can begin to narrow the scope of the analysis. People will tend to be too broad at first, partly because they aren't data professionals and partly because it makes sense to cast a wide net if you're unsure of exactly what you want and think that you can get lots of answers in a single question. The problem is that while you could get a wide range of answers to possible questions you're never going to answer every possible question someone can think of while you're presenting findings and that shouldn't be your goal because it's hard to give accurate answers on the spot like that and it can take you down a lot of unintended rabbit holes. Additionally, if you're trying to cover every base it's extremely hard to give anything more than shallow, limited answers. 

TL;DR: I think there's a good chance what you're finding is actually fine, but you should work with the intended audience to make questions narrow and specific as possible. The collaboration will also make them more invested in the answers you find together and manage expectations."

Put it in a dashboard along with some reporting from colleagues. I also have 2-3 rolling projects. Usually I am reporting some metrics or updates associated with those on a weekly cadence, depending on the project. I get adhoc requests too which I try to turn around fast. Could be a report or filter a set of data or a quick summary stat of a dataset. Usually if it is more involved than that, it becomes a project I get rolled into.

Hard to describe what those figures could be. Could be anything that gets recorded in the department. Could also be mining things that don’t get recorded. I work with several teams so the scope is pretty wide. Usually its who, what, when, where, how much, why, and who cares? Then my boss decides what to do about it."

I pull my data from a shared excel file as well as two separate databases, and compile it in a very sexy dashboard with notes/highlights added in manually.    


Most of the asks from senior management are summary reports that require some problem solving to figure out how exactly to gather the data accurately, efficiently, and intelligently (in case the report becomes a regular deliverable).  And about once ever 2-3 weeks there's some larger ask that requires a more complicated script or collaboration to get going."

wj43dt,ijir4an,5,"As a beginner I think this is a great start! I won't reiterate some of the other feedback but things to think about
1) use of colour, used subtly can be powerful in converting your points. Only use colours for a reason and to call out something of value, stand out or for focus
2) split these graphs into different pages. Instead of telling the story on one lay tell it in sections. Eg. Health, how that changed, Wealth how that changed and a third then bringing it together indicating possibly that education went up first and the other two followed
3) your axis need to be consistent. In many of your graphs on the y axis it is going up by 10s and then changes to be 1 or 5. This isn't a fair representation and shouldn't be done. With the X axis they should start from 0 or have an indication that they aren't starting from 0 to support and prevent manipulation of data

Look forward to seeing your next pass at it.

wprlq5,ikijtkj,58,"Is this a high school project? This infographic feels like something out of a political ad (where factual accuracy is unimportant).

If we go to content:
Normally you want to be careful to infer causation from correlation. Reduction in shooting of black men seems correlated with BLM protests but it also seems to have a correlation with Covid measures for example, out of the top of my mind. I would've liked a trend line with overall shootings during the same period.

Are the shootings derived weekly, monthly or yearly? No information about this which is why we need axises or a clear description nearby. Specially when you are looking at shootings from 2015-2022 (which is not over yet). From this graph it also seems like police shootings of Black where in decline before, if you look at 2015 to, BLM point.

The colors scheme makes it hard to read, change the color scheme and add axises and it will both feel łess cluttered and actually give information."
wprlq5,ikigcle,41,"Just FYI this isn't really a ""dashboard"". A dashboard typically allows the viewer to slice and manipulate the data using self-serve options (like a date selector dropdown) to discover their own insights.

wprlq5,ikimbjt,17,"I love what you’re attempting to do here, truly, but I feel like a lot of what’s included is subjective or incomplete. Especially when you’re dealing with such a sensitive and important topic, you have to stick hard to the facts, because anyone poking holes in what you’re trying to prove is going to make the overall message look bad, and then people are less likely to engage with it.

How did you come to the conclusion that shootings have gone down because of BLM? Did you factor covid into that?

Most shocking shootings needs to be replaced by something quantifiable, right now it’s subjective and just comes across as trying very hard to sensationalize some truly awful shootings, and that feels exploitative. You’d be better off showing statistics involving age of victims, whether they were armed, how many times mental illness is a factor. This reads like clickbait right now and that cheapens those stories.

The color palette is a lot. I also feel like it gives off a mixed message to use a police siren color pattern as a focal point when you’re critiquing the police."

v5w2dy,ibcbtgv,42,"Google course isn't enough.
Be ready there is A LOT of competition for entry level data positions."
v5w2dy,ibd1dr7,34,"Entry level roles are extremely competitive. Remote roles are also really competitive. Also even if a company has remote roles, there are sometimes limitations on who they’ll hire - they have to follow the laws and taxes of whatever country their employees live in, so if they don’t already have an office or employees in your country, they might not be willing to go through the hassle. 

So it’s not impossible to get a remote entry level role from anywhere, but it’s going to be hard. You’re going to need to stand out among the competition - unfortunately a certificate is not going to be enough. Generally companies want at least a bachelors degree, preferably in a STEM topic, if you have no experience. 

In the absence of a bachelors degree, don’t just do one certificate, do multiple certificates. Also many certificates don’t go deep enough, so you’ll have to keep learning the material through additional online courses. 

In the absence of experience, you’ll need to do multiple projects to demonstrate that you can apply the skills you’re learning. 

Additionally, given the absence of both, you’ll need a strong professional network to get referrals, which will increase your chances of getting an interview. 

Good luck."

uhbi7p,i7569n4,27,"I currently work as a data analyst in the finance sector and am UK based, probably the best way to give you an overview is to look at my monthly schedule.

The last week of each month is taken up with ensuring all the month-end business critical reconciliations run as necessary. This means making sure that as each department signs off that their spreadsheets are finalised our SQL jobs pick up their data and it gets input to the appropriate databases to populate reports. All the processes are years old and work as they’re supposed to (usually) so it’s not super exciting but also not difficult. I usually spend half my time on these days waiting for the emails from department heads to then trigger jobs. As and when our processes break or produce discrepancies it’s high pressure to find the fix quickly and implement but these issues happen once or twice a year. 

Outside of month end week I usually have 2/3 projects that I’m working on, usually a variety of forecast models and operational dashboards which is what I’d describe as the fun part of my job. I use python for these and ideally get to spend 4-6 hours a day working on them. 

The rest of my time is taken up with ad-hoc data requests (so-and-so wants to know how many customers who meet x & y criteria we have) so that requires SQL queries of varying complexity. I often find half of this work is actually spent helping the person define their own criteria, non-technical people rarely phrase their question correctly so there’s a bit of back and forth helping them understand their own request. 

Meetings happen but they’re not a massive drain, usually these are either to define new projects or present the findings of existing ones. I work remotely 4 days a week so most of my meetings happen on the one day I’m in the office. 

Being in a heavily regulated industry means being audited so it’s not just a case of doing the job but following set procedures, ensuring documentation is up to standard and always leaving a good audit trail. It adds stress and is a pain but the pay reflects that so I’m not complaining. 

All in all a little over half my time is spent doing technical work using python & MSSQL and the rest split between writing documentation, discussing jobs/projects, meetings and scrolling reddit"
uhbi7p,i754keh,13,"My title is Data Analyst, but I have a wide scope in my specific role. I do a mix of data engineering to data analysis. My specific role is catered to designing new reports for a large manufacturing company.

Every day I mainly will work towards the completion of a project. These projects can take roughly a month to two months on average.

In my initial phase, I do scoping and prototyping. Usually something hand entered into excel. I’ll locate the data needed and address challenges here. I bring this up with my stakeholder and we hash out what they want.

Once k know the project is credible I start the data modeling, which can be a lengthy task. Most of my current models are of a consumption nature (the row above will either add or subtract the next row of data).

This is a lot of logical thinking. I usually resolve most in prototyping, occasionally I find some data that doesn’t play well and I have to troubleshoot.

Once the model is behaving how I think it should, I have to validate. I find real examples and follow the behavior I expect and compare it to the model.

Rinse and repeat until the model is looking pretty. Then I go into visuals using power bi.

Visuals can be challenging in my role, because my stakeholders don’t specify well what they want. So I give as much perspective I think they will need and continuously check for feedback with report users.

All of this occurs while I have one off requests. This includes collaboration with colleagues on their issues. Requests to fix or change reports. Questions and challenges with the data.

I have project management meetings with my supervisor and the stake holders at least once a week if not multiple times.

Lastly I am supposed to do training to better my skills…. Supposed to"
uhbi7p,i761hrw,9,"I’ve worked in two sectors as an analyst. One at a start up and then for the government 

Startup- daily fixing of recurring reports with lots of errors or demanded changes. A lot of request for things that then never got used. I was the only one they had for a while so I had to support all directions of the company. I got calls on weekends and nights. Very stressful but I had a voice in the company. If I found that a certain product was missing an angle to explore I could talk to the directors about it or the CFO (who I reported to). I had a lot of say in what products we used. Also a lot of data cleaning because we didn’t have a dedicated data engineer. Overall very rewarding but very demanding. They also let me explore data science options and implement pet project ideas I had. 

Government: I get one small project every week or two and maybe a big one every three months. I do no actual analysis because the directors don’t want that input. They just want a report made and put up for them to see. I can’t even get in a voice on what I think is a better option for design. That bar chart they want? I guess so even if it really just a glorified pie chart with piss poor bins that don’t give any payoff on insight. Need a special table for a project? No worries you can submit the desired table needs to the technical team who will make it for you in 3 weeks even though you already wrote the SQL and just need to add the table to the schema. Overall, slow and no real voice. The pay is shit but I get to sit around my office all day doing nothing (which I hate but someone else might love). Low stress and I never get called on nights or weekend. No voice and no chance at implementing new skills. But I got to learn how to do ASP (not asp.net. The old one) and how to use MS Access to make reports. Tread lightly in government jobs because they will chain you to using outdated skills sets that harm your future prospects"

u7dvec,i5hvwup,11,"I work as a data analyst for one of the online stock brokers.  In the Dallas/Fort Worth area our company's salaries look something like this:  
Data Analyst I: $65-75k - 0 - 1.5 yrs experience  
Data Analyst II: $75-90k - 1.5 - 3 yrs XP  
Data Analyst III: $90-115k - 3 - 5 yrs XP (Manager lvl equivalent w/ no employees reporting to you)  
Data Analyst IV: $115-130k - 5 - 12 yrs XP (Senior manager lvl equivalent w/ no employees reporting to you)  
Data Analyst V: $130-150k - 12+ yrs XP (Director lvl equivalent w/ no employees reporting to you)

If you have employees reporting to you then you can add about $10k onto those ranges.  My company is weird in that you can be a director with no employees reporting to you.  So if you aren't into management you can still be compensated pretty well.  I am very confident in these ranges as our company openly shares the salary ranges with us.  The stock brokerages have made a big push towards data analysts the last 3 yrs as I think it's getting more competitive and difficult to find a decent analyst w/ prior experience.   A couple years ago these ranges would have easily been $15-20k less.

From my research it seems that data analyst salaries really depend on which industry you're in.  I've looked at some other industries in the area and it seems like they don't pay nearly as well as finance.  I'm sure there are exceptions though."

I feel like I’m being paid more like a data scientist now (which I can only imagine what that must mean for actual data scientists). It’s a great time to be in the industry because there’s clearly a lot of demand.

tpsre7,i2d19vc,28,"One option for you may be looking for a DA job at a non tech company. Just about every company you can think of needs data analysts. I got a data analytics job about 6 months out of college for a finance company with no real analytics experience other than an economics degree. They were looking less for technical skills and more for someone with the right attitude. Most technical skills you end up learning on the job anyway as some business problem will arise that you need to tackle. I think the most important quality in a data analyst is having the mindset of ""I don't know how to do that but I could probably figure it out'. 

So if you're looking for entry level jobs, don't be dismayed. Be honest about your current skill set but make sure you sell how far you've come and your ability to learn new things. When you finally do start that new job, be open about your abilities and ask plenty of questions and learn as much as you can. If they're good, they're not going to stick you with anything impossible for you to do."
tpsre7,i2d08el,16,"Hello fellow learner. I was in the same position as you are not too long ago and I still feel overwhelmed sometimes. For me, I’m doing the google cert and since it’s organized and laid out for me, it helped me not feel too overwhelmed. 

You don’t have to go that route though. I would recommend to just focus on one thing at a time, step by step. For example, you can practice SQL for x hours on x day and Tableau on another day. Your plan doesn’t need to be elaborate but even something small like that can help a lot; it did for me. Thinking about job hunting and interviewing and learning data analytics all at once will make you feel overwhelmed especially if you’re a newbie. So one thing at a time :)

And I totally feel you about being nervous after going through this subreddit. I don’t have tech experience either so I just felt anxious and overwhelmed sometimes. Changing your mindset is one of the hardest things but what helped me was to tell myself: anything worth doing is worth doing half assed. If you find it hard to take a step, just move your foot a centimeter, inch at a time."
tpsre7,i2d5tl0,9,"I am in the same boat! Non-tech background going into data analytics. It was so overwhelming when I first learned what I needed to learn and tried to figure out data analytics lingo. Slowly I am getting there.

I am on the last course of google's data analytics program and I have been taking additional courses at Maven Analytics and Xelplus to further deep-dive Exel, SQL, and Power BI. I have also read several books.

After I finish the courses I am on right now; I will find some data and try to make some portfolio projects. Start small and work from there. I feel that I will learn much more once I actually get ahold of some data and do my own analysis instead of doing step-by-step instructions from a course/book.

I still feel overwhelmed at times but I learned four very important things along the way to help me: grit, time management, you don't have to know everything, and google is your frined.

* Grit - Whenever you feel you want to give up, keep going. Fight through it and force yourself to learn something, even if it is just one lesson or one chapter.
* Time Management - Study every day; don't skip a day. If you do, it will be easier to procrastinate and give up. If you don't have much time, that is ok. Just one lesson, one chapter...SOMETHING. However, if you do miss a day, don't give up! Just get right back into it.
* You got this! Study every day, don't give up, and know where to find help.t learn everything beforehand! I'll make myself into an Excel/SQL/PowerBI guru! Yeah....that thought process crashed and burned real quick. Have a solid foundation of basics and then know enough to get the job done and work from there. I have done 4 courses and read 3 books for SQL and I STILL get overwhelmed with a lot of it. However, I know more than when I did when I first started! And I will learn much more when I have actual projects to work on. And one of the most important things: I know where to go if I don't know how to do it! I can pull up a lesson or chapter in a book that I have watched/read previously. 
* Google is your friend - You can look up anything; however, that can be overwhelming at times. Know where to look for help. Stackoverflow is a great site where you can ask/search any tech question and find answers. There are also amazing data analytics YouTubers with useful and encouraging content.

You got this! Study every day, don't give up and know where to find help."
tpsre7,i2e84gb,9,"Look man , you chose this field because you saw something in this field and you're figuring out everything all by yourself and that shows that you're passionate. I did the same , I was in sales and always loved using Excel and then my manager told me about this field. Then I research about  this field and then I created a roadmap for myself. Following are the things which are important and you should focus on if you belong from non technical background:

1.Spreadsheet and Excel 

2. SQL- If you're confused about the dialect then just go with standard SQL and practice it on MySQL.

3. R or Python- I've checked many openings for DA position ,they either want a candidate with R or Python.

4. Tableau or Power BI - Data visualisation

5. Statistics- An important skill for an analyst. I am doing a PG Diploma in Stats for deeper knowledge but you can check the video on YouTube like Khan academy, Statistics How to,etc. Stick to one source.

6. Maths - Since you'll be dealing with numbers , you should know maths.

The last two I have added myself just for more cognitive development but it's optional for you.

7. Logical reasoning - Since Data analysis is all about finding patterns, relationship and trends it's good to practice logical reasoning a bit just to understand patterns in number.

8. Your communication and soft skills, since you'll be interacting with stakeholders and team members a lot.


Once I'll acquire these skills , then I start working on my own projects. Projects are very important as it shows your employer that you have the acumen to deal with different problems. 

 If you're feeling overwhelmed then it's completely normal. It happens. It happened with and I'm sure it's happening with others. Data science is a new field and many are still figuring it out.

 As James Clear said in his book Atomic Habits and I'm paraphrasing it : Don't change you goals , change your ""system"" to achieve that goal.


Hope this helps."
tpsre7,i2d38dd,3,It’s very normal to feel this way and it won’t really go away when you get a DA job either. So I wouldn’t let it effect you so much if you can. All you can do is focus on what you know and improving on that.

Took data sets from kaggle and worked on them, and believe me most of the things I learnt was when I started doing the projects and that's when I enjoyed the process. 

Then luckily I got a paid internship in a startup, that's when my real journey to become a data analyst started.  During the internship I got to work with power BI, MySQL, google analytics etc. The duration of the internship was 6 months, just last week I completed the internship and was offered a full time position in the same startup.


I would suggest you to start doing projects, while doing the project you'll learn so much. You will get the datasets from kaggle, there you can view other people's work as well and learn fr them."

Other than than, should be a lot of overlap, I was looking for a DA position for 2 years after transitioning careers, landed a BA position for a large financial firm and couldnt be happier."
t5v6gd,hz7bjvp,7,100% take it. It will make it much easier to transition to a data analyst role
t5v6gd,hz7c22h,4,You should take it! It will open other doors and career opportunities in the future. You can transition to Data Analyst and Product Manager.
t5v6gd,hz80gd5,4,A technical Business Analyst is essentially a data analyst if you're working with data. You may also have an opportunity to move to a strict data analyst role if the opportunity opens up.

fojgd6,flfqv1v,6,"Good write-up. I'd like to add:

- be curious (investigate your data relentlessly. No matter how many times you've looked at it, make sure things still make sense; and always be asking if this is the best thing or the right way. You don't always have to ask questions, but you should always be willing to)

- be consultative (don't accept requirements at face value; understand the intent and provide guidance on how best to achieve those goals. Users and business leaders aren't data professionals; you are, and helping them understand their data and how to use it to reach their goals adds immense value)

- provide credible challenge (if you think something should be done differently, or someone is asking the wrong question for their business need, challenge them; not just to be difficult though, so make sure your challenge is backed up by experience or business understanding or better yet, both)

- understand the business (most results are useless if you don't know what they mean to the audience. This is my most important point, and it's towards the end which proves I'm an analyst and not a writer)

- understand the input systems (does a status value of ""A"" mean Active, or Approved, or Archived? Does ""CA"" mean Cancelled or Conditional Approval? Understand the systems that generate your data and what users are doing in that system)

Bonus tips:

- be aware of time zones and refresh schedules (some things might refresh daily, others monthly, others between and others beyond. Some data-as-of dates might be in GMT, others in EST, or PST, and different servers in different locations can complicate matters. Be aware of where your data lives when it's generated, where it lives while at rest, and where it lives when you access it)

- be creative (so Tableau is your visualisation tool of choice? Great. Congrats. Can Power Pivot do it better in this particular case? Point is, don't bang your head against a wall to fit a mold if the mold doesn't fit. Be creative instead)

v15zew,iakrnii,79,"I have said this a few times in previous posts asking similar but I would say that the most important thing when looking to become a Data Analyst is to make sure you understand three key things:

\- SQL - This is the most important (in my opinion) as 99% of DA roles will require you to know this.

\- Tableau / PowerBI - 99% of DA roles will require you to know a data visulisation tool. For me it was more beneficial to learn Tableau as that's what most job descriptions asked for in my area (London), but it could be PowerBI for you, so make sure to check.

\- Python/R - I am biased towards Python as I knew it before I started studying to become a DA but I would say you would need to know the fundamentals of one or the other. Similar to the visulisation tool, I would advise checking job descriptions in your area to see what is more in-demand.

I did the IBM certificate, which like the Google certificate, gives a good grasp on fundamentals but I learnt the majority of what I know through doing my own projects (it's also worth mentioning that I never got asked once about my certificate during interviews). You will need to have a good portfolio when you begin to apply for jobs which is more important than a certificate. So, I would advise doing the certificate but spend more time building out a good portfolio with a variety of SQL, Tableau/PowerBI dashboards and Python projects.

Good luck!

\*Copied my response from another post\*"
v15zew,iaktfr2,22,"This is literally asked every day at this point in this sub and similar ones. The consensus is that the certificate in and of itself is not enough. It’s a good starting point to get some basic knowledge and awareness, but to land a job, you’ll need to keep developing the skills that are covered and start doing your own projects to demonstrate the skills you’re learning."
v15zew,iakr95q,11,"Certificates are helpful but on their own not enough. Ultimately, two things matter, a CV and a good interview experience. Without a good CV, you won't get the interview, and without a good interview, you won't get the job.

zkaqtq,izz430q,13,"It depends on the job doesn’t it? You should be comfortable quickly learning and using new things, anyways. 

Here is an analogy (for whatever that is worth):
How much blacksmithing skill is enough for a blacksmith? If you’re just making horseshoes for farmers, then you only need to know how to make a horseshoe. If you’re being asked to make a ceremonial sword for the King of England, then you would need to know quite a bit. If you’re currently finding yourself pretty good at making horseshoes in your backyard, you would ideally start looking for a job where you will mainly be making horseshoes, but have the chance to learn new techniques."
zkaqtq,izzbv1s,9,"knowing the strengths and limitations of each program, for example excel can't handle a huge amount of data that python can run in seconds/mins, but manipulating smaller tables in excel is easier (for me anyway), tableau makes pretty charts with drag and drop whereas in python you have to type bunch of codes, SQL can make certain queries with simpler syntax than if you have to do in excel, etc.

the fundamentals of programming are kind of the same between various languages like C++ (for example) and python.. you need to know the variables, loops, functions.. all the way up to classes.

sometimes there are a lot of transferable concepts between programs, once you get going you'll gradually form your own knowledge ""map"", your own efficient way and how to google"
zkaqtq,izyqcu3,8,"There's no consensus on this. It would vary for every company, person, client etc.

zkaqtq,izyrvrl,6,I would also suggest learning a bit of stats and picking a vertical or a domain you are interested in solving problems for and provide solutions.

Enough so that something that is a regular process won't take you an hour each time, an ad hoc deliverable can be done in a reasonable amount of time and most importantly... enough so that you know how to word your google questions to get what you want. 

If it takes you an hour to write queries for a weekly report, I will question how good you claim to be in SQL. You are going to have to automate various tasks (to varying degrees) as a data analyst. In every analyst job I worked, I had canned reports that I either don't touch or can put together in minutes. 

There won't be a minimum required dose, because I knew of analyst jobs that needed just Excel/SQL without any Python/R or BI."
zkaqtq,j0116v0,3,"Imho if I would be you I would concentrate on SQL, Excel & Tableau for now. For the start you do not really need Python: most pandas stuff can be done with SQL, viz can be done with Tableau etc(becomes relevant with more advanced stuff). Also I would Split my time 50% SQL, 25% Tableau 25% Excel. Excel maybe even less.

Python is actually a collection of tools. It's not just one thing. Pandas is used for one thing, Matplotlib for another, sci-kit learn is another grouping of tools (each having it's own special use case). 

Python is mainly the glue that binds all of the packages together.

Pypi has over 431,000 python packages that you can install to do almost anything. Not all are related to data analysis but, there are so many niche situations where someone else in an industry or domain has already solved the problem. (Consider GIS data, physics simulations, or astronomy data). You don't have to 'reinvent the wheel'.

Conversely, if somebody hasn't already made a solution. It can be quick for a new solution to be built. Microsoft cannot keep up with all of the trends and methods used for analyzing data. So, Power BI has a module to use Python scripts."

Interviewing for any job is about first impressions (unfortunately these are not very accurate indicators of performance but study after study confirms this bias).

So, if you want to defeat this bias, focus on improving the following:
- resume. Is it visually appealing. Does it say “I have been an analyst” or “I could be a great analyst” or does it just say what classes / courses you’ve taken. Does it have typos. 
- cover letter. There’s 2 layers here. First is having one at all, that causes an impression. Second is keeping it short and to the point (2 paragraphs is good these days - show or say what you can’t show in your resume). Does it have typos or grammar issues.
- zoom / phone. Are there loud noises where you’re planning to answer the call. Do the things within the frame for your call look professional (including what can be seen of you)
- dress. Impress you’re a grownup who understands what’s currently considered business appropriate (TBH I HATE typical business casual and don’t wear it at work, but I’ll dress that way for interviews)
- talk. Learn how to talk analytics. Have a quick spiel for your analytical process, what you like about the field, what excites you about the company. Your responses shouldn’t sound canned so don’t try to prepare for any and all possible questions, just stuff that answers “I like this opportunity and this company” - people love to be liked and that includes interviewers
- handshake. Yeah, we’re shaking hands again in a lot of the world. Practice handshakes with friends or family, ask for honest feedback. Also practice asking if a handshake would be OK. Not everyone is on board with shaking hands. Skip it if you don’t like handshakes yourself, but if you stretch your hand, make it a good one.

* **Keyword salad**, do not add every possible technology you ever heard of in your CV. When I see too much claimed experience I get suspicious.
* **Claiming expertise** where you have none. If you claim you know something I will ask you about it. It is worse to claim and fail on expertise than not list it or caveat it with beginner/intermediate or similar.
* **Claiming other people's work**, e.g. sometimes CVs claim lots of successes and when I ask what the person specifically did some people can't come up with more than 'support' or 'facilitate' or 'attending planning meetings'.
* **Spelling mistakes**, if you can not be bothered to fix the spelling, capitalisation and grammar in your CV, the document representing you at your best, then I assume your attention to detail in your work will be poor.

I’ll say for my PhD I analysed such and such using excel, R. I can also do X, Y and Z on A, B, and C programs.


What I actually did for my PhD is pretty basic. But it’s a good base for talking about what I learnt in my own time if they ask a direct question saying did you do this for your PhD I would say no.

yvzwpq,iwgueyt,55,"Data Analytics really isn't an Entry Level job, despite what job postings say."
yvzwpq,iwhengl,13,"Despite the cert saying it’ll get you “job ready,” it alone is not enough. You need at least a few portfolio projects. I got the cert and was able to get 2 internships in data analytics, but they’re both special cases and i’m trying to become a software engineer anyways. Good luck with the job search, u might have to work up and get experience along the way"
yvzwpq,iwhf9v4,14,"Job requirements are often a wish list. Whether or not a company actually hires a candidate who has all the requirements depends on who applies. So your likelihood to get a job offer or even an interview depends on who else applies, and the reality is there are significantly more applicants than jobs to go around. Even people with relevant college degrees have a hard time getting jobs or even interviews. 

The reality is that Data Analyst isn’t an entry level role at most companies (despite how they are labeled on LinkedIn). Most companies prefer someone with some business knowledge because a lot of the projects given to Data Analysts are vague and we need to ask questions and apply context to understand how to solve them. 

A lot of folks working in data analytics started their careers doing something else (I started in marketing) and managed to get their hands on data in their previous role and used that to learn and get experience in data analysis, and then use those new skills and proven work to land a Data Analyst role."
yvzwpq,iwgy8ow,19,Create 3 or more project and then display it on your website. That’s the only way they know you understand the job
yvzwpq,iwi82f1,6,"If you don't have a bachelor's degree its going to be quite difficult to get a analyst job, but maybe not impossible with an awesome portfolio and a proven passion for data. It is entry level for those who have not done it before but have other relevant experience and degree (i.e sociologist, someone from marketing, business/finance, political scientist, someone with a math degree). I am currently in enrolled and flying though, but I would not have done that if I didn't already have an M.A in sociology which gave me familiarity with research design, experience with data, and social statistics."
yvzwpq,iwhw4mv,4,"It’s not a must have you can break into the field without these, but know you will be competing against a ton of applicants that have a degree and experience. Entry level data positions have hundreds of applicants these days."
yvzwpq,iwh1fck,10,"You can certainly try to apply. Won't hurt. 

That said, as someone trying to break in with just the cert, you're probably going to need some sort of a portfolio with a handful of projects demonstrating you can actually do what you say you can, or at least some applicable domain knowledge that pertains to an open position."
yvzwpq,iwhlwog,8,At least in the US a bachelor's degree is going to be a hard minimum at nearly every company. Then for candidates with a degree decisions on who to interview will come down to experience. The Data Analyst Certificate might help with this if there are doubts about your experience and if they don't have as many candidates to interview as they had hoped.

ybal2s,itfivmt,11,"Yes it's normal. It's a lot to learn in one course, especially if you have no experience with coding languages. I'm still job hunting a couple months in and continuing to learn in the process with not courses and projects. As for what to focus on, check out Luke Barousse on YT. Very helpful insights on the career and what to do next. With all the jobs I've looked at, Excel, SQL and Power BI seem to show up a lot. Python and expanding on R sure up a lot too, but most every other seem to focus on the first three I mentioned.

Hope this helps, good luck!"
ybal2s,itg1gqp,4,"Well done on getting so far. I would suggest finishing the capstone so that you get a feel for working on such a project and it gives you something to talk about in interviews.

There's a lot to know, but in many entry level jobs just knowing a couple of things can get you far and you'll build on experience as you go. 

Focussing on a few skills is a good idea. You can research roles that you would apply for and see what they are asking for. 

I would suggest working on doing more analyses while job hunting to build your experience and confidence. I've got some more detailed suggestions of how to do so in this post: https://oscarbaruffa.com/no-experience-porfolio/"

So! Fast forward when I join the company, I offer to replace, mind you, all these functions with at least some VBA and arrays (lol we didn’t get clearance for anything above), and my manager didn’t want, and would actually threaten me if I did it, because he didn’t want to lose the man days that it took to refresh the models. After all, I did it behind his back, the colleague in charge saved 8h of work a week and was super thankful.

Manager got wind of it, and was actually happy. After I told him that we should use a database for storing the data and doing the simplest computations in SQL, he greenlit me and behold, I was the proud developer of some MS Access processes. I left shortly after. The place was a mess. On my last day, I had a train to catch and the manager kept me until the end, trying to understand how access work.

I've even had to deal with CMS (Medicare) and at times I really had to scratch my head on stuff they do or screw up. 

But, that's created a lot of opportunity for the clearinghouses that sit between the providers and insurance companies, and other third party technology providers like EMR systems.  I've built a lot of analytical reports, ad-hoc reports, etc. from the data for provider clients in such positions.

I feel there's still a lot of untapped potential there for broad analysis of patient lifecycle data.  The data is owned by the providers and insurance companies, though, so running broader reports and analytics has typically been forbidden.  I think insurance companies are doing an absolute ton of work here though, as large insurers have massive amounts of data, and it feeds into how they decide what they will or won't pay for."

**Quote**

>There is a striking phonetic similarity between big data technology and pokemon names. Can you create a service that generates strings that sound like potential pokemon names? And what might be the simplest possible way to make that into a service? Also, would it be possible to generate pokemon names that start with three random characters and end with 'base' (KREBASE, MONBASE would be appropriate but IEYBASE would not be).

>Turns out that this is an interesting problem from a ML standpoint and that it is rediculously easy to build in the cloud. In my talk I will explain the ML behind it;

>markov chains
>probibalistic graphs
>rnn/lstm
>bidirectional lstm

If candidates can make it past the ATS nightmare, then they have to deal with HR/""talent acquisition"" screeners who often don't know much (if anything) about the roles they source. The next hoop to jump through is dealing with hiring managers who expect a perfect unicorn candidate to plop down in their lap. It's a broken process with many layers of problems.

All that said, if you have 5 years of analytics experience, it's probably best to avoid anything that specifically states that it's ""entry level,"" but also keep in mind that in many cases the people posting the jobs don't always properly categorize them, so the default categories remain unchanged."

Try to target a few specific industries and tailor your resumes for them. Work on projects for your portfolio that are relevant to hiring managers in those industries. This also helps to get past ATS.

Get your resume looked at by a professional.

Go to your university's career center to see if they can connect you with any companies who are hiring analytics professionals.

Last point, if you weren't able to convert 1 of those 14+ interviews into a job offer, that's definitely something to look into. You can hire a DS professional to do a mock interview with you.

They've all had simple numbers and none were a teaser, just straight up questions. Really just seemed to test if you have that ingrained knowledge of simple stats.


I think that's reasonable, and seems pretty standard. I'm not sure these teasers are as common as this post suggests. And if a company asked me one that was a ""gotcha"" I'd take it as a red flag.


One time (not DS) I got a teaser tho! When I was in aero engineering applying for my first job after grad, one company asked me something like ""if you have a x by x square with an island in the middle of diameter y surrounded by moat around it of z width - how can you get to the island with a L ft plank"". Where L was less than the width of the moat. I forget the answer, but there was some geometry trick (and maybe even a trick where you break the plank in 2?). It was soooo much more confusing than anything I've ever experienced since as a data scientist. And also honestly as an aero engineer...that interview was weird."
qrjmge,hk80r9r,11,"I had over 100 interviews in 2019 and I can tell you all the worst practices out there. This is definitely one of the worst.

Some Data Scientists think the point of an interview is to prove they are smarter than you, so they'll ask all kinds of ""gotcha"" questions. This should send out all kinds of red flags. Good managers and data scientists aren't worried about ""being smarter than everyone.""

The people responding that ""probability is important"" are missing the point. You don't test probability with ""brain teasers"". If you really want to test probability skills, just give them a quick exercise and go over it during the interview. That will tell you 500x more than doing ""probability brain teasers"" on the spot in an oral interview.

A lot of what she's talking about with ""brain teasers"" is problems that deliberately obfuscate some piece of data in order to confuse the candidate. But this is a terrible practice and it's not something you're going to typically encounter in the real world: people being deliberately misleading in their explanations of problems in order to try to lead you to incorrect conclusions. You're not testing probability or whatever skill you're trying to test; what you're testing is trust and you're saying they ""fail"" if they trust you."
qrjmge,hk7b6zc,159,"Data scientists should be *experts* in probability and probability theory.

That's what data science is *based on*.

Don't make them calculate some BS numbers by hand or whatever, but absolutely test their understanding of probability. There are A LOT of DS's that make A LOT of mistakes and poor models because they didn't have a good understanding of probability, but rather were good enough programmers that read about some cool ML models.

Understanding probability is *fundamental* to the position."

uw2a27,i9p2rqr,387,"I realize this is just a meme, so this isn't a criticism,  but there's a valid approach to dealing with this.  

When you teach a semester long class to students, you teach from the bottom up, ensuring they understand the fundamentals so they can build upon them going forward. 

However, when you give a talk to an audience of non-specialists, in a time-limited setting, you do exactly the opposite: you do top-down, explaining the big picture and only going into details as time and interest dictate.  They'll stop asking questions when they lose interest, but it's your job to anticipate and steer questions until they reach that point, breaking the subject down into progressively more granular pieces until they're satisfied.  

Almost all highly technical subjects can be explained this way.  You're Stephen hawking and you're narrating the audiobook of A Brief History of Time.  I consider it a personal failing on my behalf if I can't explain my work to a general audience in a way that doesn't leave them confused."

It's one thing explaining the reasoning behind a specific business analysis you did, another to try to explain out of content what exactly an algorithm does for people who are likely at a pre-algebra math level at best. Depends on the algorithm, of course, but some are easier than others.

Imagine your problem is building a self driving car and you're trying to do collision detection. The dataset you have is rgb 1080p video at 60fps for 3 seconds. For simplicity's sake let's assume you have 1 million of these examples (833 hours or so?) because the problem is complex and you'd like to get a really accurate result, learning from the data set. So your dataset is 1 million x (3 x 1920 x 1080 x 60 x 3)  - about 1 million samples of 1 billion features/independent variables. Assume a lower bound of each feature taking 1 Byte to store you have about 1 Petabyte of data. How do you solve the various problems arising from time and spacial complexity? Statistical concepts are definitely important, but stats alone won't solve this problem. The recent rise of neural nets is due to dramatic technology advances since the middle of the last century, making learning possible in a reasonable amount of time.

If my stats and data can back up the research, I can at least *germinate* the challenging idea in their minds. The strategy here is to not drop a bombshell on management but slowly disseminate information to them, preferably from someone inside management. This allows me to present my challenging findings sandwiched between more digestible insights. Doesn't always work out but it's better to coach people to expect bad/challenging news rather than surprising them with it.

Something along the lines of “This seems a bit wrong, maybe we should look at it from this angle.” And that happens until we arrive somewhere that an obscure and complex KPI is formulated for future use that they’re able to explain how well they’re doing. It’s funny because I’ve never seen this actually work once it is reviewed by the C-Level. They shoot holes in it until the KPI is removed from production (maybe that’s the goal?).

2) Python versions can be a qwerk at times 2.7 vs 3.6. a model estimated on 2.7 might not work when loaded in 3.6. This is the downside of open source softwares. Who will ensure we have the same algorithm version available 5 years from now? SAS logistic has been around for a very long time. Imagine explaining this to the regulators
3) SAS viyva is utilizing sklearn in the background. So its a good attempt to modernize but i think they overdid it. Cost and ease and usage can be better. My guess is they will add keras and tensorflow linkage in the near future
4) Python allows you to experience object oriented programming as well which opens plenty of non-stats related opportunities.

qph4tx,hjtvplt,151,"This is very good! I'll add one additional Q/A:

DO I NEED TO BE GOOD WITH PEOPLE?

Yes! First, when you're applying, no one wants to work with a weirdo. You should be able to have a basic conversation with people, and they shouldn't come away from it thinking you'll follow them home and wear their skin as a suit. Once you get a job, you'll be interacting with colleagues, and you'll need them to care about your analysis. Presumably, there are non-technical people making decisions you'll need to bring in as well. If you can't explain to a moderately intelligent person why they should care about the thing that took you 3 days (and cost $$$ in cloud computing costs), you probably won't have your position for long. You don't need to be the life of the party, but you should be pleasant to be around."
qph4tx,hju1lj6,30,"great post. Will just share my experience as someone who made an early career pivot from non-science role to DS. FWIW, have always had relative ease (able to quickly learn) when it comes to technical / computer / math stuff, but ended up getting Urban Planning undergrad (not much technical / math required). 

Worked for a few years, started getting good at excel data analysis and GIS (ArcMap / QGIS etc.) on-the-job and decided I wanted to dive fully into DS.

Rather than pursue a CS or generic DS grad program, I found a program that intersected DS & Urban Planning (specifically titled ""Urban Informatics""). Program focused a bit on urban theory / etc. but mostly taught the technical (statistics, programming, database management, ML, etc.) and EVERY class project was oriented towards urban planning / smart city related ""problems"". Given I already had the subject matter background / passion, that lens motivated me and made it much more tangible when learning the technical concepts.

I graduated, got an entry-level DS job (also in the ""smart city"" space), promoted to Senior DS in <2 years, promoted to Product Manager <2 years after that.

It's totally doable, but DS roles are becoming more and more niche / diversified. **My advice would be to pick a particular niche / path and pursue that** (as opposed to saying ""I want to get into DS""... OK great, that could mean 1,000 different things)"

qph4tx,hju4zef,16,"> Are you currently employed? … If you are, figure out a way to apply data science in your job... 

This was how I made the transition. My undergrad degree was liberal arts, absolutely zero math or programming or anything STEM, my primary job duties for my first few jobs out of college were writing and creating content and managing projects. But nobody on our team was using the (limited) data we had available to make decisions. I liked math, so I took it upon myself to start analyzing data, learned some stuff in Excel, and started sharing my insights. Everyone gobbled it up. Eventually the team I was on grew big enough for dedicated analytics roles and I was given my first data-related job title.


> Alternatively, network.

Honestly, once you have the basic technical skills (the stuff you see on job descriptions), you’ll probably have a much better ROI if you start focusing your time on networking instead of getting more technical skills. And now that everything is virtual, it is so much easier to network. 

The thing I’ve learned is most people hate networking and feel awkward and they probably won’t even notice your awkwardness. Also it’s not “fake” to talk to people who work in an industry you’re genuinely interested in. 

Join slack and discord communities, search meetup for groups, attend events (virtual or in person), look up your school’s alumni network or alumni on LinkedIn, connect with your classmates and recent graduates. Start talking to people and participating in conversations. Add them on LinkedIn and ask if you can schedule time to chat with them and learn more about what they do / how they go there. Most people love talking about themselves.   

The reality is, every job opening you see gets probably at least 100 applications. Entry level roles probably get significantly more. There’s a good chance your resume isn’t even getting looked at… unless you have a referral. A *real* one, please don’t spam strangers on LinkedIn asking for referrals. 


> DO I NEED TO BE GOOD WITH PEOPLE?

Yes yes yes. I’ve seen incredibly smart and qualified people presenting really valuable analysis to stakeholders, analysis that they spent months on that would really help improve the team’s outcomes. But they were so technical in their presentation that no one else in the room (marketing folks who know what an average is and that’s probably it) understood what they were talking about. And they had a hard time getting buy in or even getting recognized for their great work."

tag8l5,i011fue,116,"This looks like a great guide but unfortunately as a tech recruiter I can tell you 99% of the time cover letters are not read. 

It is much better to spend time ensuring your CV is clearly laid out, to the point, and visually pleasing. If a reader has to figure out what is going on in your CV it is not a good CV. A person must be able to look at your CV and immediately know what is going on, it should not have to be deciphered.

3- I'm doing very well over here.

4- I can't wait to see you again and play bridge together.

5- Kisses

\-------------------

1- Know who you are sending the letter to, good formula to start with.

2- Show that you researched the company and the role and that you are actually interested in it. Identify what they do and why it matters

3- Talk about what's relevant about you with respect to what you identified above. Insist more on personality and traits than skills: they also have your resumee so avoid redundancy.

4- Talk about what you will bring to the company. Show that you understand what they need and that you already constructively project yourself in the role.

5- Politeness formula to end

And just like a postcard: keep it short and to the point.

My field of study is heavy in statistics and optimization and I have 3 years of research experience in machine learning. I started applying for jobs on 4/21, primarily targeting Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer positions at non-MANGA companies. I accepted an offer yesterday. Here are some observations I had throughout the process that may be helpful for other job seekers:

\- I never got a single response from MANGA, even with referrals for several positions

\- I got several phone screens for positions which wanted 3+ years of industry experience, despite having 0. The recruiters for these positions seemed like they were having a hard time finding candidates, use this to your advantage.

\- Just mentioning that I had existing offers/other interviews scheduled to the recruiter would usually let me bypass stages of the interview process. Both of the offers I got resulted from this tactic. Don't be afraid to namedrop fancy companies, if you can.

\- The offer that I declined had a substantial on-call component to the job, but the job posting/recruiter NEVER mentioned this. If I hadn't specifically asked during a team fit call after the offer was made, they would have never told me. Be sure to ask lots of probing questions when you talk to the hiring manager/team you would join.

\- My communication was cited as one of the decisive factors leading to my offers. While technical skills are important, I got the impression that communication was highly valued at most of the companies I talked to. Don't neglect that skillset.

Edit: I wanted to clarify that I am NOT finishing my PhD. I am leaving the program after 3 years with only a masters degree."

For all their flaws and drawbacks, traditional statistical methods provide a data analysis toolbox that is based upon decades and decades of research by people who paid careful attention to whether data were sufficient to support quantitative assertions, because they were doing that work at a time when data wasn't as plentiful as it is now."
p7hpd9,h9jxhwv,111,"Agree in part, but most of the analytics problems that people are faced with don't require sophisticated modeling techniques or advanced stats knowledge, or even advanced database knowledge. The vast majority of business problems and ""insights"" can be garnered from merging/joining disparate data, cleaning that data, and filtering/sorting afterward to answer specific questions.

There's a lot of overkill in trying to fix relatively simple problems with overly complex methods and tools, because business leaders and managers don't really know how to address the issues with the analytics resources they have. Newer analytics professionals have been taught all this theory and their applied knowledge stems from having nice and neat use cases with perfect data, the right tools to use, and clearly defined objects ... which is hardly how things work in the real world."
p7hpd9,h9jzjgm,9,"Do you (or anyone) recommend a path to start mastering that ""science"" part? Assuming whatever you think are the minimum educational requirements."
p7hpd9,h9k8mkv,9,"I agree with this statement.

I think the challenge I have with anything data science related in my career development is related to science. Specifically,

- How can I motivate scientific thinking in my career when all of my clients and companies are more interested in results? Oftentimes I’m tasked to do something as a data scientist where my only responsibility is to build a monitoring dashboard primarily for convenience sake and not for any strong scientific reasons that would improve the business. I’m not sure if that’s just due to company politics, or if I’m not in the part of my career where I’m senior enough to dive into these problems.

- How can I show scientific thinking on my resume? How can I gauge scientific thinking in interviews? I think this can partially be addressed by building a portfolio to document the analytical approach I designed for any starting problems but companies seem to only care about what they can get out of data science vs. the whys in data science. They also just don’t care about the portfolio because work experience is more important. I can build a dashboard with the ideal technical architecture but I wouldn’t know how I can show the value of choose technical design decision A vs B. 

These two points make me very confused in figuring out the best strategy to move forward in my data science career. I am a pure mathematician in training, and it’s been frustrating (still is) to really not use the scientific thinking I wanted to bring in my data science career due to factors completely out of my control. It’s also frustrating when there’s no clear solution how to show it or gauge it as well. I’ve tried asking my network for advice and thoughts and unfortunately no one knows or even understands what I mean by “scientific thinking”"
p7hpd9,h9nbwns,6,"I work with two types of data scientists: physical science PhDs with ~10 years of industry experience and whip-smart junior coders with more of a CS background.

The old-school data scientists come up with the most creative approaches. They approach each problem differently, they take the time in understanding the data and its limitations before working their way up to building a model. Their models might not be terribly exciting, but they can explain every last detail of theory behind the model and why it's appropriate.

Conversely, most of the junior data scientists want to turn around as many models as possible in as short a time as they can. Every problem they're given ends up shoved in to an xgboost or scikit-learn model within hours of getting their hands on the data. They program functions to test many different types of models and then evaluate the performance to pick a ""winner."" When they're given a forecasting project, they focus their whole document praising prophet and then processing the data wholesale.

There's a middle ground. The old-school guys sneer at terms like AI and ML. The younger set takes data at face value and treats xgboost like a data science panacea. 

It's important not to completely close yourself off from some of the more ""turnkey"" packages and libraries that are becoming available, but it's **far** more important to be intellectually curious about how they work and what they're actually doing with your data."
p7hpd9,h9l16bs,6,"Well said! It seems that fundamental statistics are being omitted from the practice of DS.

I equate the ""science"" of data science to be analogous to statistics.

The other week I reviewed a presentation in which the experiment resulted in a p-value equal to 0.1. Apparently, it's common practice at my employer to say that it is ""leaning towards being statistically significant"".

All setbacks of p-value aside, how can DS be accurately applied if we exclude its backbone, i.e. statistics? Also, it seems that many companies ignore basics of experiments in design/implementation."

Sometimes, a leader makes a decision based on the information available at the time, and it's the data scientist's job to help execute that vision, not impede progress just because there's a difference of opinion for policy or the most optimal solution. 

To a certain extent, we will all encounter a situation in which we must 'smile and execute'."

f1rufm,fh8ctov,19,"This is oversimplified because I don't remember all of the details (almost two decades ago).

Worked for a company that provided Hollywood with projections for how their movies were going to perform. However, different movies would perform differently in different areas. For example, G-rated movies would perform better in small towns, while ""gansta"" movies would perform better in big cities.

Thus, on the projections interface, we would give someone a ""weight"" factor that they would learn to adjust over time, depending on where the movies were shown, and what types of movies they were showing.

The default ""weight"" was 14. Hollywood executives would bump that up or down based on their understanding of it (we worked very hard to keep this dead simple because you can't explain the complexities of this to Hollywood execs).

So we had a developer who worked for six months to overhaul all of our prediction models, because they were OK, but not good enough.

After six months of work, he released his new model, with new weight adjustments for every theater across the US, and the default ""weight"" was changed slightly.

Hollywood execs were furious, accusing us of ""fudging"" the numbers, even though we couldn't figure out how we could ""fudge"" predictions of future sales.

The developer and I went into a meeting with a vice president and the veep explained the political situation. The developer, however, then spent half an hour at a white board explaining the intricacies of the statistical model and why the default weight had to be lowered.

The white board was covered with equations. It was covered with hand-drawn graphs. The developer went on and on and on and after half an hour, the veep—whose eyes had glazed over—just said ""yeah, but change the default weight back.""

Eventually, even though our numbers were more accurate, we had to throw out the entire project because:

1. Hollywood execs adjusting those weights would see different results from before
2. No one could understand the complexity of the new system

It was a painful, expensive exercise in egos versus math.

And let's not get me started on how many times I've heard ""experts"" say that A/B test results had to be wrong because they didn't match what the experts knew."

The nature of computational thinking is that you invent a way to check the result and then shake the box until the result looks approximately right and there it is. Because implementing box shaking is easy and you can just shake the box really fast, it's a valid approach to solve problems.

How to check the result is the complex part with no ""one right way"" to do it and the reason you get paid 120k. It's also use-case specific due to ""no free lunch"" theorem.

So the whole focus on ML research is more effective and different box shaking mechanisms and what is left for the practitioner is to figure out how to pour things in the box and how to interpret what comes out.

In contrast, the field of statistics is focused on carefully crafted recipes which is pretty much a manual process and doesn't scale well when you need a new recipe every hour to keep up with the newest trends of millenials but works fairly well when whatever you're trying to model is not too complicated and doesn't change regularly."

1.	Have an elevator pitch ready. The interviewer may have been pulled into the interview the day or hour before. A good elevator pitch can help you direct the conversation (depends on the preparedness of the interviewer).

2.	Candidates should think of their responses to open ended questions as short stories: 

-	context / opening
-	answer / meat of the response
-	result / closure
-	As candidates prepare and think through their work history, they can prep the context and result piece and tailor the answers during the interview.

Effective data visualization begins not just by looking at the shape of the results but what you are trying to communicate about the data. Leading the reader to your point. 

The chart chosen can help convey the confidence and quality in the data that is valuable to someone being asked to make decisions based on it. It also builds trust:

A line over a scatter plot tells a lot more than just the line or worse, further decomposing into bars."

These are all resources focused upon putting ML into production and might help you out."
eufeqm,ffp4s8v,303,"OP’s question should be upvoted because it’s very real for many data scientists that are hired by companies who “haven’t had anyone like this before.” 

If you’re truly going to a well known tech company then  you have plenty of opportunity to cross pollinate. This is untrue for many data pros who aren’t at large tech. 

I don’t have any specific advice other than the fact that you’re worried about it in the first place is the most important. Anyone who has that attitude and fear of mediocrity will find the path to betterment. Because just being okay is never going to be enough regardless of the team you’re on."
eufeqm,ffpumtq,35,"Years of experience in machine learning engineering and building data products are distilled in this document: 
https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml"
eufeqm,ffpbqat,83,"For production level code, you should be able to learn from other engineers at the company. Pay close attention to when they talk about topics like readability or how hard it'll be to maintain/operate the code over time. People transitioning from school usually over-value code that looks impressive or is clever, and undervalue making it easy to update the code, read the code, diagnose weird behaviors at all hours, deploy the code easily, etc. At a higher level, people starting out tend to overvalue the technical and undervalue interpersonal skills. Ask for feedback early and often.

Work on meeting a few people in similar roles in other companies - meetups can sometimes help for that."
eufeqm,ffp74hn,27,"As far as preparation I would suggest trying to expose a ML model on Google cloud or AWS, either as an API or simple webpage. This should get you familiar with the process and challenges of the development cycle. Also some topics to be familiar with for whatever youre using - logging, monitoring, web servers, basic security, and some basic devops concepts.

Most importantly though I wouldn’t stress too much as your responsibility isn’t going to be monitoring, securing, or deploying to the environments. If you have questions or concerns bring it up to devops, sysadmins, or engineer managers but they’ll most likely already have most of the stuff covered since that’s part of their job. 

I think the biggest thing will be knowing how to troubleshoot and debug your own code since that will be on you (because you wrote it). So getting to know how your tools work can be important. 

Good luck it sounds like an exciting opportunity!"
eufeqm,ffplqxj,11,"Maybe not the answer you want to hear, but honestly, the best way to learn that stuff is to work at a company with more than one data scientist. I was a solo data scientist at my first DS job and I left after a year to go somewhere with a team of data scientists. I learned SO much in those two years that has been essential to my career.

With that said, if you're in a spot where you have to take this job, a few things to understand.

1) If you don't know what best practices are to be a ""full-stack data scientist"", it'll be hard for you to know whether your company has them.

2) If your company thinks that data scientists are just superpowered analysts, rather than software development professionals, it'll be really hard to get institutional buy in for some of the things you will be to be a successful developer.

3) Some things you can try on your own: build a CI/CD pipeline. Build an API using a cloud service. Stand up and take down machines in EC2. Understand source code management. Meet DevOps people in your area and ask about their jobs. Find a meaningful open source project where you can contribute and then actually write code for it.

Good luck! I don't envy your position right now but I hope you can find the right stuff to be able to build these skills."
eufeqm,ffp7fqw,16,"Just gain as much experience as you can.  While you will be the only data scientist by discipline.  It doesn't mean that those in other disciplines can't help you in  your development. Specialization is great when you need an expert.  However most times what's needed is a sharp mind with varied experience.  Use whatever experiences you encounter to sharpen your mind and expand your resume.   

Regarding the internship turning to permanent.  As an intern you salary will likely  be low.  In many cases your employer wont be willing to pay what your actually worth. Even after enjoying success during your internship.  So keep your eyes open to other opportunities.  If another opportunity pays more.  I'd take that over the comfort staying in place.  This is especially important early on in your career.  Your setting your trajectory, so set it as steep as possible.

Go after the job you want and take the job you can get if you fail to get the one  you want.  All the while never abandoning your goals.  Remember, what you do doesn't always align with who you are.

Regarding books, love books.  Many make good jumping off points.  A few are so good that they will be referred to for years.  However, in the world of IT, many books are outdated by the time they hit the shelves.  The internet has been a game changer regarding how we learn.   For example, fielding questions here on Reddit can be more meaningful than the printed page because you not only help some one else.  You also help yourself by deepening your understanding through practical application."
eufeqm,ffpnq7q,8,"Go to meetups and meet peers outside of work. Especially useful if there's a Slack workspace for the group. Troll LinkedIn and offer to buy someone a coffee to just chat about DS. You'd be surprised how many people are open to that.   
The best advice I could give is: always be hyper-focused on delivering value. Not delivering the best model or the most mathematically rigorous solution. It's often much better to do many things to a decent level of quality than to do fewer things in the same amount of time but have those things be more accurate. If the difference between a logistic regression and a 9 layer deep learning classifier would never be noticed by the end user, then use the regression. Get to a working prototype quickly and the decide if it's worth improving based on real feedback from users or stakeholders. If it's already good enough, then great. On to the the next thing. If it still needs work, figure out how much improvement it needs and just do that much.   
Try not to get lost in the weeds. Focus on delivering value."
eufeqm,ffpokql,7,"Good question, I hope to soon be in the same situation. 

People in this sub complain about there being no data science jobs, but there's tons of opportunities to create them. 

To anyone considering the analytics job market, I'd recommend reading the classic Analytics at Work, and then consider that most traditional companies are stage three companies, who are trying and often failing to be more analytical. At any such company, there is a ton of opportunity to get an analyst job, and then just be a data scientist and the push the company across the chasm between descriptive analytics and predictive analytics."
eufeqm,ffptavs,5,"If you are the only one there, I recommend getting really really in tune with the data and their business objectives before anything else.  Then design your project start to finish and figure out the ROI on different projects.

Then discuss those assumptions with the actual business people.  Dont worry about the process as much as making sure the end product is useful and testable."

ypr93q,ivkd3bz,303,"This isn’t that hot of a take. I think it’s something most of us know. 

The only adjustment I’d make is to remove the distinction entirely between DA and DS. There already isn’t much of a distinction in most companies. 

Replace DS with the title of ML and usually that’s a more meaningful differentiation."
ypr93q,ivl80yo,113,"It makes me sad when people talk about data analysts as if it's an ""easier"" choice than data science. Although they require _some_ similar tech skills, they are completely different jobs. Some data scientists I work with would make awful data analysts because they can't work with stakeholders, and they struggle to translate complex information into simple terms. Some data analysts will struggle in data science because of the long slog projects and deep technical knowledge required. Different jobs. Yes we need more analysts and they are desperately underappreciated."
ypr93q,ivkuvug,86,"Yeah, but they make less money and that's the only metric over which mommy and daddy show their love to me."
ypr93q,ivkt5yf,22,Not a hot take lol - but yes. Most companies aren't ready for DS at scale when they dont even understand what they have.
ypr93q,ivkx8qo,16,The hot take I always hear on this sub is that many DS are just analysts by another name.
ypr93q,ivlv5hp,15,"Let’s put it bluntly. A Data Analyst role, supported by a team a of Data Engineers, is probably what most companies need. I think that requires a scaling of analysts technical capabilities. But it should be sufficient to build reporting and less complex machine learning applications. I also believe companies with “simples” ML requirements can outsource DS roles to bring up certain projects to life during development and maintenance. But this still means that 80% of the deliverables fall in the scope of modern data analytics. This is also relevant for companies in transition, finding their ML-driven business model at a more sustainable cost. And there’s no shame in it, I would even pin point the opposite. So I fundamentally agree."
ypr93q,ivkthq1,46,"I have a similar hot take: data science is not a full time job. Focus on being a DS + analyst, or a DS + DE, or a DS + SWE, or DS + consultant, etc."

Coming to only having kaggle experience,  I think the hate is overblown. It's definitely not very useful in most (almost all) corporate settings where you almost never have good data. Data prre processing, EDA, building data pipelines for continuous inference( Somw companies push this to DE teams) etc are the skillsets one requires to survive in real DS environments. But that doesn't mean kaggle competitions are completely worthless. They narrow down your focus to just building models and achieving incrementally higher accuracy metrics. The later has no use in most corporate environments. But the former is useful to keep updated with the latest in the field. 

I don't see that as a negative. Yea people who feel it's a substitute to owning actual projects are just priming themselves up for disappointment

Also most grandmasters in Kaggle also happen to be proper DS specialists who don't just build models but frequently contribute to open source projects to make DE jobs easier. 

Having kaggle projects is better than not having them so the ""it's just recreational"" part isn't true. But at the same time, only solving kaggle problems is like only solving leetcode problems and thinking you will be a good SWE. It will help you in the interviews but you are almost never gonna use those solutions in your work."

I asked why and was expecting them to talk about the pros and cons of the model, but instead they just said it's one of the most frequently used models on Kaggle.

I've never used it myself, but I think Kaggle is a good supplemental learning tool. But you still have to understand why certain tools work better in different scenarios."

Did the analysis and provided numbers of market size, average loan etc.  The head of strategy did his own “analysis” and my results dodn’t match his. Keep in mind our head of strategy isn’t data person and can barely use excel.
When he saw the inconsistency in his and mine results he immediately was dismissive saying mine are incorrect. We later set up a meeting with credit bureau representatives where they acknowledged that my numbers reflect the right market size and match their numbers.

wz7pfk,im0w54k,86,"(No Answer = Didn't hear back 3 months after applying)

**Evolution of Requirements**:

After I graduated from grad school I was pretty idealistic. ""Hell yeah, with a biomed PhD and data-based dissertation the biomed/health industry will want me fosho"" I thought. 

September - January:
* Applied to only biomedical, health, fitness related data science jobs, entry level or otherwise. Remote only, US or worldwide. Mostly startups.

February - May:
* Applied to the bio above, but expanded to data analysis. Remote only, US or worldwide. Expanded to startups and small companies.

May - Today:
* Literally all jobs. Fintech, finance, education, automobile, bio, health, insurance, house insurance. Data science, data analysis positions at all levels. Startups, small companies, corporations (Ford, Nationwide, etc.). Remote, hybrid, onsite (with the thought of going fully remote after gaining a year of experience). 

**Background**

Started applying straight after graduating with my PhD in Biomedical Science in September. Honestly started pretty half-heartedly, been in academia for 15 years and I was ready to travel. So that's what I did. From September until now I've been traveling to different cities, trying out the nomadic lifestyle and completely fell in love with it. Funds started getting low around May so I went all in on the applications, and made these graphs. By July-August I had interviews 2-3x/week.

**My experience:**

- 15 years academia: Bachelors, Masters, PhD.
- 2x DS bootcamps: DataCamp (Python + R), DataQuest (Python) (latter highly recommended)
- DS projects from bootcamps + my own projects from silly (marathon placement predictor) to the serious (Covid Dashboard)
- One 4-6 month part time pro-bono stint as the first data scientist at a startup, implementing super basic ML (Random Forest) to predict interesting timestamps from twitch streams. The main challenge here was feature engineering, data warehouses. 100% Python
- One 2 month part time contractor as a software engineer, automating SQL code using Python
- Dissertation during Covid years: building multimodal regression models to find which dependent variable most contributed to our outcome (50% python, 50% R)

**Job stats:**

Starting May I went from 1-3 applications to 10/day. This resulted in:

- 838 applications
- 41 resulting in at least one interview
- I have this data but not gathered, but around 10 going to the final interview
- 3 offers
- I rejected one fully remote (US only) in February, all kinds of issues came up during contract negotiation and I learned of their employee turnover rate (roughly annual)
- I accepted one month long contract (on site) in August
- Rejected one full time (hybrid and super interesting, but a toxic admin from my experience and from Glassdoor reviews) in August

**Future:**

- Finish the month long contract. It's a startup, these kind of startups like to do a one month ""trial"" and then offer a full time position after that. CEO indicated he would like me to get on full time once the contract is over.
- Current plan is to request fully remote (within or outside US) after the contract is over. They're stickler to this weird onsite-preferred-but-hybrid-tolerated thing and I'm not into that at all. 
- If accepted within US: travel around the US visiting family and feeling out different cities I would like to live in
- If dreams come true and outside US is fine: continue my Latin American travels, or head to Europe to visit family
- If rejected: use my savings from this job (90/hr) to continue travels and applications"

wz7pfk,im0wpf7,326,"Congrats on landing a job. Respectfully, I'd recommend learning to network effectively. You'll find that you get many more interviews. Sending out 800+ applications seems like an insane amount of wasted effort. Applying cold is very much a numbers game, but it doesn't have to be!"
wz7pfk,im14ktb,13,"I kept a spreadsheet my senior year of college with every job I applied to, the status, and then a column with the end result. 
My family was shocked whenever they learned i had applied to 350+ jobs. 
And what’s funny, I didn’t get a single offer from any job I applied to online. Found the job I took by going on an industry tour. 
It’s a rigged numbers game for that first job- good on you for powering through. That next job in 2-5 years will undoubtedly come easier!"

wz7pfk,im2f7tq,9,I fully disagree it’s just a numbers game. My first job in the field was with a small local company and was the first job I ever applied for in the field. I just got a second job after putting in less than 10 applications. I didn’t get the first job I got a call back for but got hired at the second place that gave me an interview. I think too many people go for quantity of applications rather than quality. Tailor your resume to the job posting and focus hard on interviewing for that specific company and you will have much more luck.

To allow data scientists to truly focus on ML/AI/BI, companies need to build a solid data foundation (the bottom three levels of the hierarchy) before tackling areas such as AI and ML."

- Don't be afraid to say no if you think something shouldn't be your job to do so.

- Take few accounting, finance, and marketing courses at one point in the future (this is more to do with money management and if one day you start your own company, knowing how the financials work are pretty critical), the knowledge will help you grow in the long run + Learn how to sell yourself.

If your not sure about something dont do it. Follow the rules 100%.

And still call me data-analyst. Oh and they also pay me like a first-line helpdesker."
cmit48,ew4fvye,6,"It's super role dependent. If you're just handling requests all day, every day, you end up as the Meg. But my team tends to be pretty autonomous and is more about insights and strategy than turning commercial requests into reports or dashboards (although we have some junior analysts working on those).

Unfortunately ""Data Analyst"" covers a wide gamut. Recently I read about a data analyst at some random marketing agency complaining he was actively being discouraged from using Python (ok fine, different teams have different work flows and you can get a lot done with just Excel) and SQL (!!!!!!). ""Data analyst"" titles like that make job searching pretty treacherous and muddle data for salary baselines, which is pretty frustrating.

Of course, same can be said for ""Data Scientist"". At another company I could DEFINITELY have a ""Data Scientist"" title for pretty much the same work I'm doing now, whereas my current company Data Scientists tend to more engineering-focused (although my team's Data Scientist works more in theory and research). I have to admit, it's tempting to move over into such a role just because pay will likely go up for a different title for the same work. But there's no real clear ""lanes"" to speak of now."

Just chiming in here.  I would guess that most data science people are 'linear' and 'structured' thinkers.  They are at their best working one or two projects at once, and don't like to have 'lots of balls in the air'.

I know that I do best with two projects at a time:  If I'm stuck on one, I can work on the other.  Then, when I return back to the original, I often find myself 'unstuck'.  But if I have four projects on my desk, I have to spend extra energy making sure I'm not accidentally forgetting something."

It's presented as this opportunity to design truly novel architectures but you don't need to even learn calc or linear algebra because it's already baked into TF and PyTorch."
rgb80b,hojpqdw,20,"Yeah, this needs to be said more. It really does.

People don't really understand how much depth a subfield of a subfield can have, that's excluding possible applications to and from other fields; now magnify this times all of the subfields in the field.

Now imagine how many fields influence data science: statistics (philosophy and mathematics), computer science (programming and mathematics), AI (programming, cognitive psychology, linguistics, logic), any particular domain-specific knowledge for the project at hand (predicting real estate prices, working with finance, consulting physicists), etc.

You can't learn all of the math behind the very foundations (real analysis, complex analysis, probability theory, combinatorics, mathematical statistics, theory of point estimation, measure theory, ODEs, SDEs, Ito's integral, stochastic processes, stochastic ODEs, stochastic PDEs, stochastic optimization, linear programming), let alone everything. Whoever says they have, is lying.

Even if you could learn some filed by heart, you could still turn out useless. My economics professor used to say how a certain group of analysts were brilliant in their math background, but they made the stupidest of mistakes when tackling real data because they didn't account for obvious systemic anomalies which their models couldn't predict (something about due dates, practices, and legislation, I think.

Clustering? I first saw it in the 80s; it's probably been around longer than that. 

Natural language processing? The fathers of AI were talking about that in the 60s. 

Neural networks? That was a big thing in the 80s. We did OCR with it but hardware limited us to only recognizing a few characters simultaneously.

The real difference is that now we have the processing speed and memory to do things on a massive scale. Also, we now have easy access to huge data sets. But the math and the underlying principles are the same.

That's why I don't worry about an AI apocalypse any time soon. We can create a program that gives the illusion of self-awareness, but the truth is, Alexa has no idea how she is today."

This is from Benedict Evans' (of a16z) blog. I think the second paragraph is especially important in this context -  I can think of no better way of putting the point across. Especially true for people taking part in Data Science challenges and pretending to 'help'."
fm17ja,fl2bzej,21,"So here’s some areas DS/tech can help with, if people are inclined to help. 

* Reports are coming in PDFs from WHO and there are people out there trying to collate those into data sources that can be used as a data feed. 
* local areas especially are reporting data at a level that’s hard to be useful at a national level, but is very useful locally. 
* Building submission forms - most communicable disease reporting to states are still done via paper.
* Data presentation/visualization NOT forecasts or prediction

If you are doing modelling, make sure to put a giant caveat if you have no epidemiological experience."
fm17ja,fl1t8ql,158,"Hey guys, I want to just voice my opinion here too. 

MODELING AND FORECASTING COVID-19 IS NOT USEFUL TO ANYONE. There are tons of people who are doing this who are way more qualified than any of us. Nobody is going to listen to you and you will not make any impact, they will be listening to experts.

 So, how can we help? Try and think what you can do for your community! Can you organize donations to restaurants to make curbside deliveries to senior citizens? Can you organize donations of DIY medical equipment to hospitals? Connect tailors and fabric manufacturers in your community to make PPEs? [Connect distilleries to hospitals so the distilleries can produce hand sanitizers for the hospital](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nJiPDbuiekMvNwOnbTdM3XRWOEQUrbSz&usp=sharing)? There is so much stuff that actually has an impact that you can do, just as someone with any degree of technical skills (web scraping, deploying shit). You can definitely help, ***just stop making medium posts about your model that predicts the same thing as every other model using code you borrowed***.

We'd better HOPE no one's looking at the ""cool new dashboards"" everyone's building. If they are, some of us may very well have fucked up some people's *actual lives.*

Just because you don't have an MD doesn't mean ""First, do no harm"" is a bad rule. Misinforming people about health or misrepresenting health data is a fantastic way to do harm and very little else.

The arguable best ways to help are pretty much the same for us as they are for everyone else:

1. Self-isolate
2. Wash your damn hands
3. Spend money on local businesses that might implode and charities that are helping and donate to research if possible
4. Give blood/platelets
5. Help each other and stay sane

If I said I work with machine learning they'd probably ask if I know what AlphaGo is or if I've heard of Cambridge Analytica lol

I combine statistics, database work and programming

I was able to price and reprice simulations of a portfolio of options in a few seconds after fitting the payout curve of the portfolio.

Also how did you prioritize learning how to ""do"" data science vs learning how to interview? I get the impression from posts here that they are almost different things entirely."
k7iytr,gesd865,52,"Did you get an offer from a startup? They can be loose with titles. Otherwise a MS in stats won't get you a senior level position unless you are really really really good at all DS things or have been a SDE for awhile. Congratulations though! The journey is tough. If I were you I'd stay there for as long as you can because if you have the senior title, you will need to be at that level for your next position."
k7iytr,getg19j,6,Congrats on your achievement mate. How do you get random people in LinkedIn to get you referrals?

If you had massive IT experience on that front, then it should've been easy to land any Data Science job, be it entry or not.

But I'm wondering: by the way you described the interview process, it looks like companies in the US conflating Senior Data Science and Machine Learning Researchers together. Did you have experience pushing ML models to production? What is your tech stack for anything after a Jupyter Notebook?"
k7iytr,get4c6s,3,"Great resource, thanks for posting this! I occasionally get people asking me how to get a job in data science and I will save this post and refer them to it. 

Regarding salary, this should always be a question you ask during the very first interview with a recruiter or hiring manager depending on how big the company is. Be sure to ask about total compensation, which breaks down into some combination of base, stock, and bonus. If they ask you what your expectations are, don't give a number but use the keywords ""market rate"". This isn't the time to negotiate, it's where you learn if the interview process is going to be worth your time."
k7iytr,getcp9w,3,"Tbh sounds awful. Wonder who things will be when I am back on the market (although I plabln to stay self-employed).
The maximum effort I ever had was sending out CVs and doing a few hours of interviews (and no whiteboard or practice coding either, giving a talk about my thesis was the absolut max).

This time I was lucky because my manager was a very smart guy and I learned quite a lot from him. The pay was below market but I acquired lot of new skills.

opnzmc,h66kyn6,33,"""*On my 1st month I was working with the wrong tables*""  <-- This is squarely your manager's fault.  I manage a team and I would be the one that had to take responsibility for this because I had failed to give you the right info and verify access.

Regarding month 2 and 3 and not getting the right numbers--it depends on the DB.  In my first year to two years, I'll be honest:  I pulled shit wrong all the time.  I cringe when I think about some of the things I presented because I know I fucked a join somewhere.  This is expected for a 3-month graduate...

TBH, this sounds like a failure on the management to (1) understand that new grads take 6 at least 6-12 months to get up to speed and (2) provide the necessary guidance to do the job.

Seriously, what if the data cleaning is part of the analysis itself, and the ""cleaning"" is arbitrary that could be expressed by a simple JS function? Will that be a game-changer in the visual analytic tools market?

&#x200B;

Here is a real example (repro steps):

1. A dirty data set with dirty ""column"" but we know how to clean it - [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQON2med2bf2OIXoZZRNWtHQk0-4PARgN0vySCSos5c/edit#gid=0)
2. One-click to load the sheet for analysis, [the link](https://columns.ai/load/gsheet/1qQON2med2bf2OIXoZZRNWtHQk0-4PARgN0vySCSos5c).
3. Open the **console** under the main canvas and paste below cleaning code there.
4. Click execute button ""<>"", we sum values grouped by the real keys.

\[console\]

`const x = () => {`  
  `const d = nebula.column('dirty');`  
  `const m = d.match(/^.*(#[a-z0-9]+).*$/);`  
  `if(!m || m.length <1) return 'none';`  
  `return m[1];`  
`};`  
`columns`  
`.apply('clean', columns.Type.STRING, x)`  
`.select('clean',sum('value'))`  
`.run()`

&#x200B;

It may not solve all ""cleaning"" cases, but sufficient for many, how do you think this type of capability to reduce the ""data cleaning/prep"" step for much analytical work? Share your thoughts from all different perspectives..."

I started learning Python from scratch on my own on my first few days in Europe, then received a DataCamp account. Started my course on Data science. Then I secured a first summer internship at a big 4 without a salary. I said to myself it is fine, I gain experience now, maybe later I can find a job. Then I got a second internship on december 2020 at a second big4 until april 2021.

Then to my luck, I got recruited by a company as a Data Analyst and got my first official salary a few days ago.

From this project, I learned quite a bit include Docker containerization, Git branching, Azure and Object oriented programming.

In my current project, I am able to use the skills I learned to create value for my team where we’re building an end to end data pipeline for geospatial analytics. I came woefully prepared for it due to my past experiences, and was able to offer immediate value for the project. My project manager was already surprised that I completed half of my assigned tickets in one day.

u1ivbw,i4fyosh,23,"I think your approach is sound, but there are two things you are glossing over, and one relates to the other:

**How did you get that first job?** Because once you get your 1st job and one year of experience in DS, $100K a year is easy peasy lemon squeezy. The hard part isn't the 2nd job - the hard part is getting your foot in the door.

Which leads me to the second thing you glossed over - **your school performance was excellent.** 

You said you went to a no-name college - wihch would normally be a negative for most people. However, you made up for it by getting a) multiple minors (and multiple majors?), and a 3.7 GPA. 

This is something that I believe wholeheartedly (and I know a lot of hiring managers that do too): the best student at almost any school is likely going to be a better employee than the average student at a great school. And there are several reasons for this:

* Some people can't afford to go to the better schools, and end up going wherever they go because that was the best school that offered them a full ride (or that allowed them to remain living at home with parents to save on room and board). 
* Some people slacked in high school, but got their shit together in college. Or maybe were not motivated in HS but found their motivation in college.

So going to a lesser school isn't the death sentence many think it is. But it does mean that, if at all possible, you need to kick ass at it.

There's two sides to this:

* Most people, when they're applying for jobs, can't change how they did in school. Or what they did. 
* For those of you who are early in your school career - school matters. Get the grades. Get a minor. Get a second major. Make your resume scream ""I rocked it at school""."

Since I started I've automated the data pulls they were doing manually every day, from multiple disparate sources. I automated data conditioning and loaded it into a SQL database. The whole ETL process, using a python environment I set up. And been writing SQL queries to make views to feed dashboards and peoples excel files.

I haven't even gotten to the point of doing the 'data science' stuff yet. I've just been setting everything up to get there. I've found so much hinky shit with the data. Some I've sent tickets to the source to get fixed, others I've had to write conditioning code to fix before use.

I keep thinking about that guy who quit, from what I understand he had recently graduated with a real degree, he wasn't inexperienced though he was ex military. I guess he expected all the data to be ready and good to go. Your story about the PhDs made me think of him again.

I have no leg to stand though on I'm totally self taught, I was a geospatial analyst before becoming a data scientist. Man geospatial data can be a hot mess. Maybe that's why I stuck around, I'm used to getting malformed data and having to clean it up."

It does happen that at certain point of time, the team will hit an inflection point where low hanging fruits are picked and deep knowledge on a data topic is required - NLP, time series forecasting, to make meaningful improvement.

uryrot,i92mz3x,8,"I am a PhD myself. While I agree with the general narrative of the post, but I think it is an unrealistic expectation that the PhDs should have devops skill. The problem lies elsewhere.

The truth is: not all quantitative domain require writing production level codes that entails the best software engineering practices. It is just not required. Their expertise is somewhere else. Because, there is a generalization about the PhDs going in most of the job description, the PhDs jump into these (because they are tired of doing the contractual postdocs).

Just like you were deliberately avoiding hiring PhDs, I was deliberately avoiding roles that do not require a PhD. I guess this helps everyone. Working with data engineers for couple of months helped shaping my data engineering and devops skills. At the same time, I get to sharpen my R&D skills - which is my specialty.

PhDs here: take note. Your goal is not building models. Your goal is to add measurable values and finding the alphas.  To do that you will need to understand ETL, build custom architectures (DL or ML), experiment tracking, deployment and monitoring. Once you have these under your belt, you are unstoppable."
uryrot,i915qtc,33,There is a data science maturity model. PhDs can help with the raw research and experimentation side of things.

rxm4ej,hrjay7w,432,SQL is great. But as soon as you're recognised as 'the SQL person' you will remain the SQL person.
rxm4ej,hrj6s5l,176,I think a major issue with SQL in DS is that it often isn't properly taught at university. Students are often given a data set or told to go find a data set online and then just read in the csv and begin the model building process.
rxm4ej,hrjm0fj,91,"I think it’s one of those things where on the surface it may seem easy but once you get to really know it, you realize there’s a lot you don’t/didn’t know. I used to do the SQL screens for DS candidates, I always asked “On a scale of 1-10, what would you rate yourself in terms of SQL knowledge and what does that number mean to you?” I got candidates saying 8-9 and didn’t know when/why you use a self join. I started to notice a trend in candidates and the overall community, most people who look down on SQL and stats aren’t reaaaaaally data experts. Those same people, at least in my exp, also tend to be the same ones that will try to use ML for everything even when a simple rules engine would work just fine. Or they’d just do a “select *” and do all the cleaning in python because they think it’s “better” but in reality it was clunky and slow. Being an expert doesn’t mean you always approach things with the coolest newest tool, it’s knowing when to use the right tools for the job."

Then I look at these queries 6 months later and have absolutely no clue how they worked, and have to run bits and pieces through the query engine to figure out exactly how this bloody jigsaw ever fit together.  


A powerful SQL routine does a lot of work for you very efficiently and is well worth having in your quiver. But I think in some ways it's inherently a challenging language to use well."
rxm4ej,hrjorck,52,"SQL is great. I think it is easier to do most of data cleaning and feature engineering using purely sql.

rxm4ej,hrjv1o0,45,It's a core skill. I won't hire a data scientist that isn't competent in SQL.
rxm4ej,hrj3n8c,107,"Okay, playing devil's advocate for a second:

ETL + dashboarding type analysis/analytics are not data science. That doesn't mean they aren't super valuable skills, but they ought to be part of another role.

The reason why people balk at them is that employers rebranded these BI / analyst titles to data science but they're more or less a bait-and-switch for people that actually want to be doing something else.

Personally I've dealt with ELT/Data engineering and built an enterprise grade data product from scratch in the past. Imo it helps to have gone through the trenches, done reporting on data quality, sat together with stakeholders to get your visuals right etc however I would never ever take a role that is *purely* SQL/analyst based because that's just not what I want to do nor do I consider any of that to be data science.

Don't get me wrong, your organisation needs people in these roles and you should love and appreciate them as a data scientist because they enable you. If a project wouldn't have anyone that has credible experience in any of these domains I wouldn't mind doing it myself / teaching the rest so long as it doesn't become my sole responsibility."

I find it rude tbh, they are requiring me to sacrifice 3h or more so that they have less work. Now imagine you're applying for ten different open vacancies, that's easily 50h of work managing everything. I don't think its much different for data scientists than for devs.

I have a feeling that the more people do them, the worse it gets."
rsfdlx,hqm5h77,229,"I did a six hour take-home after I was promised by the recruiter I would get feedback on my work no matter what. After they reviewed my work and declined to continue with my candidacy, the recruiter said they couldn't offer me any feedback.

The thing that gets me the most? This was for an internship. *An internship.*"
rsfdlx,hqm78bx,69,Here's an easy solution to your problem: Tell companies that give you said test to go pound sand up their ass instead. It's a seller's market.
rsfdlx,hqmc7wx,52,"It used to be that companies just wanted to make sure you were competent enough to learn the work within a reasonable amount of time, then at some point it became that they want you to walk into the position fully trained on whatever the specialized corner of the field they need."
rsfdlx,hqmbklu,26,"Any testing of over an hour should only be used as a final verification before sending you a letter of offer and they should be paid. Anything else is grossly disrespectful and, arguably, unethical."
rsfdlx,hqmjlgc,19,"I never do them anymore. If they ask for a brief 30 min to 1 hour thing, sure why not. But if they're asking to fully construct a huge big ass analysis with a shit ton of data cleaning, no. I don't care if it's a FAANG paying a lot of money, just no.

I've been there and done it before and 100% of the time it's not worth it. You either get rejected  w/ no feedback and wasted your time OR the job was a total joke in itself that didn't actually use anything other than SQL."
rsfdlx,hqmi1n4,8,"This is why I refuse to perform take home tests... They show a lack of respect for candidates time and if enough people refuse to take them, they will stop."
rsfdlx,hqm6tbc,20,Please feel free to name and shame.
rsfdlx,hqmb26e,38,"I am going to assume you are in the US or another country with anti-discrimination laws.

The reason they don’t give you feedback is to cover their ass. Imagine if you will that you are told you made a 95 out of a 100 on the test. Now imagine they turned you down while bringing on someone who only made a 70 on it. What the company doesn’t want is for you to find out about the hired person’s grade (let’s face it, there are people that would definitely post “hey, I applied to XYZ and got hired despite only getting a 70% on their test— is this normal?” ).

Why would they care about you finding out the other person’s grade? Let’s say you belong to protected group X and the person hired belongs to protected group Y.  Then you failing to get hired despite getting a better objective performance measurement than the person who did might lead you to believe you had been discriminated against. You might even file a report with the appropriate governmental agency which might then investigate employer. Investigations are expensive and open the company up to potential litigation and ensuing settlements. They may even be fined by the government. This can be true even if the company wasn’t discriminating intentionally (see “disparate impact” analysis if you are in the US— your business can have completely legitimate metrics and lose a discrimination claim if a protected group happens to perform disproportionally worse  than another group does on average).

So how do companies try to avoid even being faced with an investigation? They generally refuse to tell you why they didn’t hire you, what you could do better, etc. or at least the companies with decent legal counsel do."

p29bae,h8ivheh,23,"{Lots of Sarcasm ahead}

I interviewed the company's CEO (ofcourse unpaid)

This is what he had to say - 



Reason why they keep it unpaid -   
  
\#1 -  The work is seen as 'too intellectual' to be paid.  We tend to think of someone who's in a job that's highly technical and difficult (software developer, physicist) and associate it with big salaries. In contrast we see data science as a simple concept – ""Hey look at all the data on google trends I can use!"" – and so are not ready for the significant difficulty level involved in practice. . 

\#2 – The work involves both computers and human activities, which means it is hard to make a clear value calculation.  Many of the activities that data scientists do are things that have been in demand for years (traffic analysis, searching through large amounts of information) – but people used to doing them manually don't realize how much effort is involved in automating these processes, because they've done them by hand for so long.  Do you think this is an easy thing to do? Or time-consuming? And how can I put a value on something like that?  

\#3 - Data Science is a 'lottery ticket' job – theres no standard definition of one and so it's hard for employers who don't know much about the world of data science to know how much they should pay for one."

klppo6,gha9a3r,45,"Agreed! Having worked in data science- adjacent fields I can confirm that there are lots of self-professed data scientists with a vague understanding of the fundamentals. Fortunately for them, plenty of those hiring ‘data scientists’ really only want some basic skills to impress. Using terms like ‘data mining’ or ‘algorithm’ sounds impressive to lots of folks including those hiring self-trained data scientists."
klppo6,ghadh1c,36,"Other posts have mentioned the knowledge gaps coming from potential candidates in data science, but a large part of the gaps also come from companies and hiring managers misunderstanding their own business issues and/or simply being unaware about them overall.

I've seen countless situations where the underlying issues weren't solved by data science gurus, but by decreasing layers of convoluted processes, cleaning datasets, ""finding"" and joining data, and making sense of data via easily understandable metrics and reporting.

It's great that so many people want to get into ""analytics,"" but so much of the supposed need and demand is inflated and overestimated due to a lack of fundamentally understanding root causes of business problems within companies' own managers/executives."
klppo6,ghaa3ie,301,"I understand people who want to change fields and become data scientists. Data science requires at minimum strong coding skills in SQL/Python/R, data visualizations, machine learning algorithms theory and implementation, and statistics. It is not something one picks up in a 2 week bootcamp. Come interview time, you would regret thinking that!

To get the job, two things matter most, the resume and interview. Resumes must list all the key data science skills, past work experience using data science, and value delivered. The interview can really cover anything.

I didn't really think about it too much at the time. Shortly after graduating though, I started investing more time into learning programming, then SQL, machine learning etc. I started doing some projects and as I got deeper into the field, I realized that I really enjoy the process, I like working with data and could see myself doing it for the long term. 

I do think it's a bit odd that there are people who don't seem to particularly like coding or working with datasets or mathematics, but want to get into the field. Maybe they like the idea of doing data-science (and believing it comes with a good paycheck?) more than they like the field."

My perspective is that there aren't a lot of fields where self-taught and boot camp people have a chance. I understand the job market is tough even for someone with a degree, but unlike other fields at least to you don't have licensing requirements. 

You don't hire an accountant without an accountant degree. You don't hire a nurse, dentist, speech pathology without a license and a degree..... But people have self taught themselves into a DS career, even if it's a path most fail at."

The biggest thing that takes it from being impossible to being powerful is really understanding level of detail calcs and how Tableau deals with data granularity. Once you grasp that it becomes so useful and so fast. Pre-aggregating also helps - I find Tableau has a hard time with data that's more than a few million rows. Right now you're at the ""peak of Mt. Stupid"" on the Dunning-Kruger curve. If you keep pushing you'll understand there's a lot more you can do with Tableau than you realize."
vxuxhv,ifzkjk8,61,"I know you're still an intern, and thus still in the ""I am so much smarter than these people"" phase of your career, but you are 100% wrong.

Companies don't use Tableau for you.  Your ease of use isn't the primary use case for Tableau or similar tools.  Tableau exists to provide an enterprise wide tool, accessible to non-techies, with consistent tooling, behaviour, and common look and feel across dozens or hundreds of dashboards.

Can you code up some half-assed Streamlit dashboard faster than in Tableau?  Maybe.  But you cannot deliver the enterprise-wide benefits of Tableau with your home grown one off tool with anywhere approaching the ease and scalability.

TLDR; you're not using Tableau to make your life easier, you're using it to make everyone else's life easier."
vxuxhv,ifyjpnx,589,"If your company is like a lot of places, there are probably loads of people who know how to use Tableau, whose job it is to build and maintain dashboards; meanwhile there might be some folks who know Python, but they have better things to do than update your dashboard every time it needs to display the new season's widget categories. Your manager's job is to make sure your projects provide value to the company even after you're gone, of course you can't just use whatever tools you want, no one wants to maintain a giant pile of random intern bullshit.

Tableau has its pain points for sure, but once you know what you're doing it shouldn't take you all day to make a quarterly sales graph. IME, it's faster than ggplot for a lot of simple exploratory data analysis and basic business graphs, but becomes absolutely infuriating the instant you try to do anything really interesting or outside the bounds of what it considers data viz best practice (their design team is quite open about how it's an opinionated piece of software)."
vxuxhv,ifyn52l,247,I usually clean/format data with Python then dump it in Tableau. Then you just drag and drop. I can build a dashboard in an hour if the data is formatted well. Tableau is insanely easy to use.
vxuxhv,ifyxj5z,239,"Heads up interns, if your company wants you to build a tableau dashboard, it's probably a good idea to build a tableau dashboard."
vxuxhv,ifyljyi,86,"I think part of the problem is just knowing how best to use Tableau. The data structure I find it works best with isn't what you'd expect. There's also a helluva lot of clicking that ruined my wrist. But, I'm in charge of reporting for a moderately large company. It's pretty cheap to get a dashboard up and running, looking nice in a few hours. You can also automate and use code to update the underlying XML to help. It has been way better than anything else any other team in my company has come up with. JavaScript dashboards are the nicest looking ones, but we have so much trouble keeping them up to date or porting them for other uses. Folks leave and then they're tough to maintain, at least at an SMB that doesn't focus on web. Everything in Dash, plotly, and ggplot just takes so much time with trial and error, but these also work fine. In the end, I think you can make any of these tools work for you just fine if you're comfortable with them.  Tableau just happens to have a lower barrier to entry, so it gets chosen for that purpose.  You can get a lot more out of it than you think."
vxuxhv,ifyyey5,127,"Paint a different picture: imagine all you ever knew was Excel. All of sudden your manager wants you to use python. Your first couple of weeks would’ve likely left you wondering “why such complexity to… remove decimals… or build a pivot table…” or whatever. But before long you’d realise you can do so much more with python.

I’m by no means suggesting Tableau is “more powerful” than python. I’m just saying it serves its own purpose - to put data in the hands of those who probably never written a line of code.

You don’t have to love it, but I’m sure you’ll nail it shortly and will use where it makes business sense.

PS. Whether your business users are “stupid” or not, it’s for them who you’re doing what you’re doing… given your end-user background, what is the best way to help them make evidence based decisions timely: python or Tableau or something else?"
vxuxhv,ifyms3i,70,Try to use R/Python for all data manipulation/calculated fields and use Tableau mostly for visualisation on the curated data. Tableau is indeed slow when you pass the calculation within the tool.
vxuxhv,ifz2hur,23,"Yes, it’s slow. And I agree that it’s slow in terms of getting a simple graph up. But that is not it’s strength. You’re an absolute knob if you think you can rebuild the functionality quickly. It’s very front-loaded. But after you set it up, it’s quite flexible. 

But, yeah, for a quickie graph, anything else is prob faster."
vxuxhv,ifz6slj,21,Just think about how long it would take you to build an SSO or the level of security Tableau offers to your org in streamlit. How much time would you spend on deployment and or maintenance? Howxmuch on support? How much would it take you to build the same level of gui that allows people to change things in streamlit? There is a reason tools such as Tableau thrive.

My background is in math so I write scripts that do statistical stuff. After a database guy sets up everything, after a ml person builds models, but before a tableau person makes it all look pretty. 

If someone’s good at all of that then great! Everything seems to be getting more and more specialized though and that’s going to lead to more and more people focusing on specific things."
j1q5w2,g70ylmo,40,Problem is most employers don't have well defined responsibilities for a DS. You'd probably be expected to do a thousand and one things in a company that has a messy DS department.
j1q5w2,g70z2ut,16,"For 75-85% of the market this may be true. Both webmasters and data scientists were/are at the mercy of SAAS built by their colleagues. 85% of businesses can get away with templated solutions, not yet in DS, but when you get 5-10 brilliant webmasters or data scientists and say let’s get a piece of the 85% market share, it happens. Sure you can rake in tons of money in that remaining 15%, but in technology the beast will eat the beast, always has, always will."
j1q5w2,g72pe1j,8,"Yes. This is bang on. To take this analogy even further, Data Science of 2020 is the ""computer knowledge"" of the late 80s-90s. Back then hundreds of traditional jobs were being replaced by computers and it was necessary that u needed younger folks who were up-skilled enough to explain to senior folks how to cut costs.

These ""computer skills"" were advertised to young graduates as technical skills which could be learnt outside of college. The teaching institute wouldn't offer any fancy degree or diploma but just a certificate of completion to slap on the resume.

I saw that first hand at my Dad's office where conditions forced him to learn COBOL, FOTRAN and SQL while he was working in the Finance division of a government office. As an electrical engineer, it was a punishment posting but he turned the opportunity around to write code for the monthly payroll processes. That code is being used till this date.

Cut to this decade and there are so many parallels you can draw. Replace ""coding"" from another era with ""automation"" of 2020. Its practically the same cycle.

I foresee that a lot of Data Science will be (or already is) commodified. Agencies will start developing plug and play tools and move away from service-driven business. This will allow faster results and hopefully cause firms can start invest in more resources towards the data science departments."
j1q5w2,g71p4hy,4,"To me, when I see those questions, I usually read them as, ""What formal schooling, certifications, paperwork do I need to have to feel comfortable calling myself a data scientist?""  We live in a world that is dominated by degrees and formal education, I think a lot of people flounder when you tell them that they just have to learn some things on their own.  Getting a degree in *something* just shows employers that you allegedly have the ability to focus on things.

j1q5w2,g70vwzh,19,"It's always been the case where a new way to glue pieces together is highly valued and sought, but quickly loses its luster.

Every time some software, libraries, packages etc. come out written by software engineers that makes it an extremely simple process for anyone to do.

People got hyped up by a shiny new title and a fad, salaries rocketed upward, but we're already to the point where it's becoming incredibly easy.

You want to make money and do interesting work with a long career path?  Stick with software engineering.  Make the things others use.  Don't be someone who glues bits together.

If your job is just importing some csv, using some script to clean it, using some other pre-built library to run some stats, and using some other software to generate displays, your entire job could be replaced with a script that does those few steps.

The writing is on the wall."

I do also work as a quant and I do also regard as Kaggle as tool to really teach about validation and sometimes about feature engineering (but this is highly situational on about the dataset).

Honestly, Kaggle is my go to website if I want to check something new, find some inspiration about techniques and stuff. Even more so then papers nowadays. I do mostly do time series stuff and I have tried to replicate so many papers that all have some kind of subtle look-ahead bias. They all have some nice tables reporting how they beat SotA and thus it resulted in a published paper. But they are ultimately useless for live prediction. 

Kaggle solves that since people who explained their work after getting a good place did so on never seen data in a highly competitive environment. It is really good as a learning resource and also beats those countless error filled medium articles that are written by students or entry level data scientists."

Data: Self-gathered data on interview process, kept in a spreadsheet.

Time: 2 months of applying after completing my MS in Statistics in Dec of 2018

Location: NYC

Title: Data Scientist (Predictive Modeling)

Background: 3 years ago I discovered this sub, and dabbled in statistical modeling during my undergraduate degree (economics.) I greatly enjoyed taking data and making predictions out of it, and saw that I could do it for a living as something called a Data Scientist. After countless rejections with just a bachelors and my lame job that was analysis in Excel, I decided to enroll in graduate school and obtain my MS in Statistics to improve the statistical skills I had. I also moved to a job involving large databases and SQL, as I heard countless times that SQL is important in any data analysis role.

The hardest part was definitely breaking into the field, as most jobs required 1+ years of experience doing predictive modeling in past roles with R and Python. However, during school I spent a lot of time on my personal projects, and dedicated myself to becoming fluent in R and Python. I also worked really hard on my soft skills, such as communication and business acumen during my two jobs. My projects, these soft skills, and my machine learning knowledge had the best feedback during my interviews. Believe it or not, there is still a huge demand for the field (at least in NYC), as both jobs that I landed required 2-4 years of experience.

EDIT: You guys are awesome, thank you for the overwhelmingly positive response! My inbox is blowing up on people asking for advice - I will try to answer as much of them as I can. "
aohn8w,eg15t4g,18,"7/8 on coding challenges!! Good for you, congrats on the new job. "
aohn8w,eg10cei,31,"Taboo question (but it shouldn't be, especially since we're anonymous), what's the pay like for entry-level DS in NYC?"
aohn8w,eg11f1y,12,"Is this common for people to send out this many apps? 

I’m not DS, but work in Financial Services. My application to job acceptance ratio has been about 5:1. But, I’ve also been very targeted and relied heavily on referrals from personal connections. "
aohn8w,eg0xcjp,29,"That's great for you. I'm not in this field but am considering getting into it. I do find it very odd that there are so many openings out there but people are reporting that it is a competitive job search. When I look at openings in Austin, there are too many to count. I'm sure NYC has lots of openings too. Where do employers expect people to get their minimum 2 year experience from? I also noted that many people that work as DS do not have DS related degrees (like Stats or CS), they have degrees in hard sciences and transitioned into it by doing some SQL and stats analyses on the side (I checked Linkedin). Usually when there is a shortage of people, employers fight over candidates and relax their requirements. I do not see that in DS. So does that mean there is not a shortage of candidates?"
aohn8w,eg10y5n,5,"Congratulations on your big score!  Nice to hear that someone does finally make it! I have a BS in applied econ as well and have been adding skills on my own around DS and DA for the last four years.  Well, it's a long list of things learned, which all started with the ""Statistical Learning"" Stanford course in 2014.  I was just looking at the curriculum for an MS in Stats at San Jose State a couple of days ago.  I am currently out looking for a next opportunity after a test engineering gig ended last Oct. In the last year there where two Udemy courses completed on SQL as well, but I seem to struggle to even get any kind of stepping stone position, which I would gladly settle for at this point. Any thoughts? I'm already on Upwork and Freelancer as well too.  Feel free to DM if anyone likes.   "

Secondly, this post is scaring the shit out of me! I'm about to start my MSc (Data Science) after spending 3 years working in an excel based analysis job. My UG was Finance/Math rather than Economics but apart from that were very similar. I've upskilling myself in Python and moved to a data science-ish role for a few months before the MSc. It sounds like when I graduate I'll be in a very similar situation to you, and to be honest.. I was expecting at that point to land relatively quickly into a DS job.

drde9q,f6hskpg,11,Where is Logistic Regression?
drde9q,f6huwhm,7,"Even though the concepts of regression are important, I feel that a lot of these methods are more useful when a controlled experiment has been conducted. 

Most of the examples for students online learning regression is “housing prices” but besides something like that there are so many other factors that will influence a response variable that it’s difficult to have a very tight prediction. Obviously this depends on the problem and the industry but in my experience it’s had problematic results. 

In my case I’ve had to give sales predictions for new products based on other products (hint: it’s really hard to do that since you don’t have the data for the new products). I gave a list to some stakeholders and they were like “ok, first one... makes sense.... second one... ok.... third.... what is this?! It’s not going to sell that much! What is this?!” And even though the model has a decent R^2 and other metrics there’s still some error involved. Some business people can’t understand that whereas every statistician/data science person I’ve told this too is like “well, yeah, duh, nothing has 100% accuracy”. 

In those cases it was a bit better to convert it to a classification problem and use buckets for the outcome because that slowed for a bit more wiggle room in the prediction. 

My main point is that you can learn all these methods, but a big part of data science is how you’re going to present this and work with your stakeholders."

Data cleaning/prepping is a critical skill and a hard one to teach a computer since the rules for cleaning are found outside of existing lines of code. 

The day this hurdle is overcome is the day self-service becomes the norm."
bupmyf,epj6nr6,6,"Dumb question: what part of the process exactly is considered data cleaning? Is it a loose term or something specific that data scientists refer to.

There are parts of my workflow where I have to figure out a ""fix"" because of weird traits in the data (eg. I work on hyperspectral remote sensing and often times the spectral channels are different between different sources of data). Other times I just have to figure out more basic things like how the data is stored/formatted or identify some outliers/bad data that need to be removed.

Sure data preparation is important, but why are we so happy to be spending so much time on what is pretty much universally the more menial part of the process? I for one do everything I can to reduce it as much as I can, be it by trying to convince the data sources to validate and structure input before it's stored, or by speaking to domain experts who understand the subject matter better so I don't have to randomly or exhaustively try ways to engineer the data..."

lqozmp,gohr4t2,187,"Great post.  I can tell you, as someone who has been a ""Data Scientist""  since 2011  and a few years of remote sensing scientist before that, that you did significantly better than I would have.

Do most people run into interviews like this?  My experience hasn't been this way.  I've had to code and solve problems but they're rarely 
questions like this.  These are the kind of thing I'd look up when trying to solve a specific problem but wouldn't know offhand.   Usually the questions have been more in line with being given a data set or SQL table and having to solve various things, write functions to accomplish a task, or solving expected values of some various problems.  Admittedly, I havent interviewed seriously in 5 years, but I know there is no way I'd pass this without some serious brushing up.

Nice job, seems like you did well!"
lqozmp,gohp3ai,69,"I think for #2 he just wanted you to explicitly say we do some sort of feature selection or dimensionality reduction to deal with the curse of dimensionality, especially after saying he wanted to do a linear regression."
lqozmp,gohtadm,32,"Seems like you did well. This depth of questioning isn't the norm from what I've experienced and interviewed with. Might make sense if the candidate promoted themselves as deeply knowledgeable about time series modeling. The risk is that the candidate is not familiar with the particular approach and the interviewer gets a read that's not well represented for the actual role needs.

Also seems like an awful large amount of questions in 45 minutes. Lends itself to litmus test filtering questions conditioned on prior specific experience rather than generalist critical thinking and communication."
lqozmp,gohxsl8,13,"Agreed with all the other sentiments here, you did very well answering these questions! 

For #9, Customer Lifetime Value is usually defined as the discounted expected transactions over the period a customer chooses to do business with a company. Generally the more useful way to think of it is the discounted expected residual transactions - i.e. how many more transactions we think a customer will have with us before going away. In the case of an OTT streaming service you're probably dealing with a contractual customer relationship (they pay their monthly subscription fee) where you can identify a particular moment when a customer chooses to not be a customer anymore (they choose to not renew their contract). In this case, calculating CLV becomes a more straightforward regression problem. You can take your segmentation criteria and use it as your independent variables predict a customer's expected relationship length with your company.

Best of luck with the rest of the interview process!"
lqozmp,gohqrzh,43,"So you stumbled upon an arima fanatic....
I would hire you based on your answers, I guess you are not familiar with recommender systems but you have a good understanding of DS in general and your logic and judgement seem fina.

My only advice would be that you should learn which questions aim for a broad answer and elaborate more on those. I think when he asked you about how to apply a constraint a proper answer should start with ""oh, many different approaches"". Your straightforward answer may be a red flag if he thinks ""he will only consider one option"". Same about the segmentation question where I find your answer shortsighted."
lqozmp,gohte2l,8,"For #2 , without knowing anymore, you could also apply one-hot-encoding with l1 norm (lasso regression). 

\#5 In real world , IMO the client dictates how many K-mean cluster they want. Most DS applications are not a noble research . 

\#19 This could be exploration vs. exploitation. 

  
No A/B testing ???"
lqozmp,gohvey4,12,"Really good responses, I feel like I learned a bit from this post and I'm considered a ""Data Scientist"".  Whew I would've blown the interview if it were this specific and lengthy.  Honestly I don't think you said anything wrong, maybe interviewer was on tilt (pandemic will do this to people).  

Interviews are a rather emotional journey, if it were an algorithm, they would just hire the best (experience, knowledge, etc.) and no need for interview.

You're effectively in a vacuum and the problem is often that you have too much information and no good way to sort through it. Learning is always a communal excercise - there's a reason we put children in a class room rather than by themselves in a room full of books. Information is not the issue here.

I know that when I started, I put transitioning questions in the subreddit rather than the sticky - because one or two kind people would reply before the mods would remove the post (as opposed to the sticky where after three weeks I still wouldn't have an answer). I was overwhelmed and knowing that an actual person answered specifically to my question made all the difference for my understanding - and at that point I had a PhD, three years worth of industry experience (non-DS), a background in molecular simulation and linux as well as thorough grasp of basic maths and statistics. 

I mean I bloody well know how to do research and work by myself, independently. Still, I was really struggling to enter the field. It's a tough field to enter and all the good information on the web is downright useless if you just drown in it.

So, nowadays I try to go through the transitioning thread and answer questions that I can (especially looking for chemistry background). Because to me the learning process as an adult is not that much different from childhood in that I need other people to properly learn.

Having said that, I also agree with you that the sub is full of these beginner questions and if it were moderated to a different set of rules, I think, I might benefit more from it, now that I have a DS job.

There's a kind way to teach someone how to properly save money (or enter DS, respectively) but I also agree that if this was all the sub would were to do, it would be fairly useless to me. So, in essence, if we had a better balance that would be nice.

y6w5ab,iss5rae,8,Yes but how do I get a job?
y6w5ab,isrn5e5,86,"bruh it's because the space is filled with BI jobs and vague AI/ML promises. No skills needed bruh.

I studied so hard in college and was working on master's level math/data science while an undergrad. I was teaching other students in the math lab, making clubs, and doing uni. sponsored research, got a gov. contract on math related project, and doing kaggle.

Only to find out through my first job out of college that my boss just liked percentages and pretty charts.

Statistics is ""just a school thing"" and ML is just ""sexy"". no time for that stuff when we have charts to make.

Lol ok I guess, thanks for the mid level salary.

The jobs I'm actually qualified for won't even glance at my resume until I have 2-3 YOE (I'm only [25% of the way there](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/25%25_pie_chart.svg/1024px-25%25_pie_chart.svg.png)).

So for the time being I'm in BI purgatory atoning for my sins of presumption, and not simply majoring in CS/leetcoding my face off until I got into MANGA."
y6w5ab,isrz8g4,19,I’m genuinely trying to break into the industry gathering experience and a graduate degree with a thesis in ML&NNs and it does seem that there are way too many sources/job postings that are essentially scams or get rich quick style of thinking/marketing. Just makes the whole thing confusing and I guess that’s why people ask so frequently so that they can cut through the BS gimmicks. That’s my opinion anyways.
y6w5ab,isrlbhs,26,It’s the same in the programming groups and most hobby groups as well. People who don’t want to search or research
vceaxx,iceykty,1276,">If you are considering a DS MSc, I think it’s worth pointing out that you can learn a lot more for a lot less money by doing an open masters or courses on udemy, edx etc

Yeah but then you wouldn't interview them."
vceaxx,icdzjlh,498,"For 1 though you don’t just log transform just cause the histogram is skewed. Its about the conditional distribution for Y|X, not the marginal. 

And for the Xs in a regression its not even about the distribution at all, its about linearity/functional form. Its perfectly possible for X ro be non-normal but linearly related to Y or normal but nonlinearly related and then you may consider transforming (by something, not necessarily log but that’s one) to make it linear. 

Theres lot of bad material out there about transformations. Its actually more nuanced than it seems."
vceaxx,icegqnb,125,"I'm about to finish a program in data analytics.  I worked very hard and did not cheat, but I don't remember enough because I don't use it after the class is over."
vceaxx,iceike3,80,"I'm honestly curious as I've been hearing that DS roles require a Masters degree at least. Which is what OP has been interviewing, yet at the end OP suggested taking online courses on udem, edx or just reading books.

If the job requires a graduate degree, doing what OP suggested won't even get you an interview right?"
vceaxx,icf1sxg,300,"It's amusing to me reading posts from senior data scientists on here expecting fresh grads to be prepared to be professionals in their field right from the jump because they got a masters' degree in DS. I've got some advice for you:

(1) If you want people who have strong quantitative reasoning skills (e.g., understand statistics)  start interviewing people that spent more time studying statistics / econometrics / mathematics, versus people that got a masters degree in dashboarding with a minor in copy and pasting code from money-grabbing universities that invented the DS MSc to capitalize on labor market trends

(2) It's somewhat amusing to me that you expect fresh grads to possess a deep understanding of machine learning algorithms. Masters programs often demand many, many hours of work, but that work is often only enough to get the initial, broad exposure to a lot of different concepts, and usually as soon as you really start to understand something, you've got to move on to cram in a bunch of new information without ever truly applying it. Nobody has the time to memorize 'introduction to statistical learning' in grad school. I used the book for my ML class and it's fantastic, but you can only cover so much in one class. Deep understanding requires repeated application of concepts... that happens on the job. Not in school.

(3) I agree they should have some understanding of concepts like CV, feature engineering, and grid searches. These are fundamental, but again, maybe you should consider other degrees if you actually want students who understand these concepts.

(4) I think senior data scientists might often forget that the knowledge barrier to even begin studying DS concepts is often very high. So, again, most of the candidates are only getting their initial exposure through their masters', not actually mastering the material. So, forgetting what cross-validation is during an interview when maybe that was only something that was covered on one exam in one class.. not actually that surprising.

(5) In no other technical field that I know of do managers expect new grads to come out of college and just know how to do a job immediately. Seems there's often little interest in training / mentoring employees. I studied biomed / chem as an undergrad and worked in an analytical lab for 4 years before going back to school. There was an extensive training program even though I had a degree in the field. Nobody expects you to just show up and know how to run a flawless HPLC and troubleshoot every problem because you took 2-3 years of chemistry and spent a few hours / week in a lab. That's insane. You get broad exposure to the fundamentals and this sets you up to cement knowledge when you get the opportunity to repeatedly apply it.

Also... I'm bitter because I'm not even getting interviews with a listed Applied Econ (with conc. in econometrics & stats) degree and I know I'm losing out to DS grads from ""top universities"" who really just breezed through a cookie cutter degree designed to make money, when I actually designed my own masters' degree specifically for this type of job. But I'm not even getting the chance because why when here's a million ""Data Science"" grads lined up right next to me.

So, I apologize if I come off as rude, but this job market is frustrating me atm haha"
vceaxx,ice48j7,38,"Not a masters, but I’m finishing my undergrad degree this month in a DS-related course, and I feel like I’m the person you’re describing. It feels like we barely scratched the surface on statistics and probability, for example.

So many DS degrees (especially PG) have been cobbled together to jump on the trend. I’ve got a list as long as my arm of stuff I think I need to cover in more depth, it’s frustrating to finish 4 years of education worked around a FT job and still have to do months of self-study. I was looking at a conversion masters in CS but I’m really disillusioned that there’s so many new PGs that have sprung out of nowhere, promising to turn you into a DS or SWE in two years if you’ll just give them £15k to do it."
vceaxx,icfen2c,35,"Do you not think you’re being a bit harsh considering it’s a graduate position?

So it’s likely these people have never had to apply this stuff outside of being taught it once for the purpose of a single project or exam? 

People also get nervous because it’s an interview, and obviously you being mr galaxy brian would know there’s research out there that suggests people are better are remembering stuff in high pressure situations over multiple attempts. You know… just like you would have in the actual job. 

Maybe if you took your head out of your arse you’d be able to see and hear lots of candidates have the perfect qualities to make GRADUATE data scientists that don’t include being able to recite everything that was taught in a year. These MSc’s aren’t handed out for free you know."
vceaxx,icecsbl,94,"IMO masters in stats focused far too much on theory and not nearly enough on applied methods. I only had a few projects, 3 or 4 max, and a couple of classes based around statistical methods. I'm not sure how I'll ever use the matrix math or double integral calculus going forward.

I did 1 semester with bayesian methods, that's all forgotten by now. 1 class we did contrasts in SAS - obviously I haven't done that since.

Yes, I would have much preferred the entire time spent learning how to properly clean data, choose methods, train and score models, cross validate, and analyze results but at the same time you guys can provide SOME on the job training and stop expecting everyone to come in with every single qualification."
vceaxx,iceyq2y,23,"I'd actually feel some level of concern for companies and candidate pools but the fact of the matter is most DS jobs are at least as braindead as you claim your Master's applicants to be.

The true job posting: PhD in quantitative field with demonstrated experience writing production-grade software, machine learning models, domain expertise, and an mastery of statistics needed for our choice of EDA hell, Excel automation, Tableau dashboarding, t-tests ad infinitum, or deadlocked corporate bureaucracy."
vceaxx,icdv232,147,"So as someone who just finished my MSDS, posts like this used to surprise me. All of this stuff is covered in more than one of the classes that was required for my degree. It baffles me that someone could get through the program and not know this stuff. 

But then I realized a lot of my classmates where copying each other’s work. Maybe not during the same class, but they would pass it around to each other since most profs gave the same homework assignments every quarter. 

So. Yeah. It’s not the curriculum that’s the issue. It’s the fact that so much cheating goes unchecked and you have students receiving degrees without doing the work.

As someone who literally cried trying to finish some of my assignments, it would annoy me, but posts like this confirm they probably aren’t landing jobs, so, sucks to be them. 

(I actually transitioned from marketing to analytics before I enrolled in my program and worked full-time the entire time so I have 6 years of experience and I’m not worried about landing jobs.)"
ons0gh,h5trkhs,624,"In my opinion, it is much safer to develop expertise in a domain (healthcare, insurance, banking etc.) and then apply data science principles to your domain. That's what I have done. I am not a data scientist and nobody will hire me for my data science ""skills"" (honestly I am not skilled like many people in this sub). Instead I have been able to cement my reputation (and get good raises) as I brought data driven insights and speed to decision making in my job. This may not be possible for everyone but developing domain expertise and then applying data science is easier that chasing a few pure play data science positions."
ons0gh,h5ukz6k,61,"Eh ive just finished university, all my friends on accountancy or other similar courses are up against 200 applicants for every position. I think this is a wider trend in the job market rather than data science and I think comparatively data science is doing well for itself"
ons0gh,h5upq0w,59,"Yeah where I live in England, Data Scientists are needed all the time. Don’t assume just because the job market is saturated where you live, it applies across the world, otherwise you’re just gonna scare under-grads that they’re not gonna get a job"
ons0gh,h5uglrx,55,"The industry is the wild west. Everyone sees the common themes: no one knows what data scientist means, misaligned expectations, non existent workflows and pipelines, companies having no strategy when hiring a data scientist, frankly inability to identify strengths, etc, etc. It's going to be like this for a while. Best way in as I see it, get some sme knowledge and learn the data science pieces. Take focused course work with this edge. Building models is foundational, and yet probably less than 10% of the battle."
ons0gh,h5tqod2,135,[deleted]
ons0gh,h5uhp0c,36,"My company is still hiring as many as possible and getting only a few applicants, so..."
ons0gh,h5tytv7,78,"To be fair, there's a ton of demand right now, so some of these folks will get lucky.

I have been talking to a lot of companies lately while I evaluate the job market (I'm considered experienced by DS standards), and I've determined that companies absolutely have no idea how to hire data scientists. Recruiters can be swayed by buzz words, there's a ridiculous reliance on take home assignments that actually favor the inexperienced (you have a full week to do a '5 hour' assignment, who will do better: the recent grad with no time commitments or the person with a fulltime job and a family?), and folks are being promoted to manager/director with barely any experience or training (I've excused myself from consideration more than once because the hiring manager graduated from college 2 years ago with no additional experience). All these poor hiring practices actually benefit folks new to the industry"
ons0gh,h5uoor3,27,"I came from a degree in chemistry. While I agree that the hiring process sucks, consider that the frustration you feel is in part (perhaps even most part) due to that.

Even with the glut of inexperienced DS, the competition isnt nearly as stiff as chemistry, you only have so many chemical plants at so many places. DS is vibrant and easy relative to that.

That doesn't make finding a job easy, just realise that when you complain about a saturated market, it's still far easier than other fields that are actually quite stagnant.

So yes, it's not a walk in the park and it is frustrating, but I maintain that the frustration you feel is because of the hiring process mostly. Ultimately the largest companies in the world have built their companies off of this for better or worse, the market will be here for a long time to come.

Edit: forgot to mention as well a relatively severe downturn (again, ugh) in the market due to the pandemic"
ons0gh,h5txype,119,">The supply of entry level workers is probably double if not triple the demand(made up statistic).

I think waaaay too many people are still hung up on the ""sexiest job of the 21st century"" title that was declared by the Harvard Business Review. 

Remember, that was published almost 10 years ago. The market and the reality on the ground for companies have changed since then, and the article doesn't ring as much true any more."
ons0gh,h5uiewa,65,"I'm going to start my MS in Data Science this Fall. Despite all the talk about a saturated US job market, I see that nearly all graduates from my program eventually find lucrative roles in the industry (data is fully disclosed on the program website). 

On top of that, I have already acquired 2.5 years of work-ex as a Data Scientist in the FMCG/Retail sector. So I'm also counting on my past experiences to give me a slight advantage while hunting for jobs.

vzmcc2,ig9gb51,8,Awesome work! I was also curious if you have an opinion on improving a LI resume? I’ve recently started building my LI profile and I’m trying to figure out with their layout if more info is better than needed info as the resume is not constrained to 1 page.
vzmcc2,igaobs3,9,"One thing I would emphasize that I don't do and I should:

Post.

I (like many) tend to get hung up on ""well, I don't know if the stuff I want to post will be relevant"".

Doesn't matter, post. Post about your journey. Post about things you've learned. Post questions.

The goal isn't to contribute great content - the goal is to create content. Any content. 

For two reasons:

1. What OP already said - so that any and all LI search algorithms prioritize you when possible.
2. Because if someone does look at your resume, there is a very strong bias towards looking deeper into profiles that have something to look at. 

This is the same reason behind why it's important to have a picture - because if you have no content, no picture, no listed education, etc., then I am going to assume that you're not active on LinkedIn, therefore that I am going to have a low probability of actually getting you engaged with a potential job opportunity.

By contrast, if I see that you update your profile, that you take care of making sure it looks good, that you post, etc., it makes me believe that this is a good avenue to reach you AND I get to see some samples of the work you do."

Some suggestions for improvement:

Don't commit after each SQL line to make it more efficient. (Just add a semicolon on line 54, switch = to +=. Finally, move all the lines that follow  one tab to the left. 

Also close your DB at the end. Line 64 one tab to the left.

Some suggestions of things you can add to make it simpler to use:

\- Allow multiple symbol entries at once. Hint: use split function which puts the symbols into an array.

\- Read symbols from a file: This way you have a config file you can easily adjust without touching your code. In half a year you won't know everything that happens here so it's easier for yourself.

i4w86p,g0lbon0,448,"Me: Excel, this is a string of numbers, don't apply any formatting.

Excel: No"
i4w86p,g0lxej4,104,"So, to provide insight from someone who is doing bioinformatics for my PhD (since a lot of comments seem to think this is an issue for the bioinformatics/comp bio people themselves):

This is not a problem bioinformaticists *cause,* per se, or something that really affects our work *if we are given access original raw files*. Standard tools in bioinformatics include R, Python, etc. No one directly involved in the field uses Excel for any ""serious"" analysis. We can all program to some extent.

What *does* happen, however, it that we have to pass data on to wet lab biologists - i.e., the people who actually perform experiments. This group of people generally cannot program at all or have a very, very limited understanding of how to run (not *write*) scripts that are written for them. They also generally do not understand the concept of file formats beyond Word vs. PDF vs. Excel, etc. The idea of csv, tsv, etc. is not something they are familiar with.

The ends up causing the following chain of events:

1) Bioinformaticist run RNAseq analysis, ultimately generating a table of gene counts with samples as columns and genes as rows. This is saved in a txt or csv file. Associated plots are generated to display results (heatmaps, volcano plots, etc.), and the final output table with adjusted p values, fold-changes, etc. from differential analysis is produced and saved as a txt or csv.

2) Wet lab biologist wants the raw counts table in addition to the figures and final output table. This is absolutely fine in concept. They should have the raw table too!

3) Bioinformaticist shares (via email or a cloud storage system or what have you) the files as the original txt or csv.

4) Wet lab biologist wants to make this easier for them to see. Keep in mind, they cannot (by and large) use R or Python, so they use Excel. They then save a copy for themselves as an Excel workbook, so they can sort, conditional format, etc. This results in several gene names getting converted to dates; however, given the human genome is 18-20,000 genes, and some of the oddly named genes are not super popular to study, this goes entirely unnoticed by the wet lab biologist (who may or may not even know this is an issue).

In the end, the chance of this issue getting addressed by the wet lab biologist is slim to none - this has been a documented issue since microarrays were standard technology. So, in order to prevent it from even occurring to begin with, the computational people have taken it upon themselves to fix by just changing gene names/annotations."
i4w86p,g0ltqns,31,Seems like both incels and Excel have issues with misreading things as dates.
i4w86p,g0ljdah,42,This is funny because gene and protein nomenclature is sooo inconsistent across different databases. Having excel read genes as dates is literally a drop in that the ocean of redundancies across genomic databases.
i4w86p,g0lk02f,29,"From another post of mine here:

Excel date-time values are demons wrapped in vomit, enclosed in gilded enamel boxes that look great, and provide no hint of the evil inside them."
i4w86p,g0lrryr,65,"Why are you all opening source data files \*with\* Excel? If you're going to use Excel, you should open a blank Excel workbook, *then* query\\import\\connect \*to\* the original file.

Treat Excel like you would R or Python--import the data, don't just double click on a .csv like some kind of barbarian."

Self-taught individuals can have a prolific DS careers if they posses a personal constitution aligned with that of a scientist's.

Keep fallacies and biases in check.
Accept that your current skills and knowledge will be outdated sooner than you think, while realizing that your findings and work can directly contribute to your own obsolescence. The abilities of current top tier DSs will be overshadowed by the most junior DSs decades later. 
Unless you are incredibly disciplined, realize data science outside of academia is generally a young man's pursuit. State-of-the art algorithms, code, etc will, for the most part, be written by students in graduate programs.
The true value of scientists for/in the private sector is in their ability to translate and communicate findings to their general audience.

However, then I went to an IT consultancy. Literally everything was done in Excel, apart from some models where SPSS was mandatory... Ok, I know how to SPSS, I learnt it at university but noticed it still lacks some important features, hence why I quickly transitioned to Python and R afterwards.

Does not matter, still, I needed to use SPSS for the ""complex"" tasks and Excel for everything else. Market modelling? Get away with your segment modeling in R, here is some Excel template which gets f'cked over by other colleagues since they constantly open your files to copy something only to accidently overwrite formulas and saving it! *Cries in lack of version control* ""Hey you know how to dashboard? Great, can you please set something up... IN EXCEL?!"" Ok, here's some half-dynamic output with customized click fields triggering formulas in hidden and blank-colored tables behind some graphs hosted on a server.""

In our company, data analysis is still done by triggering a handcrafted print driver noodling through fixed-column ASCII data (you remember the predecessor of CSV?)  in order to churn out some PostScript (you remember the predecessor of PDF?) files, which I hard-parse to get some format I can almost work with.

Fortunately, a client of us has been laughing over the solutions we still offer and he sincerely wished for something not '1980'. I laughed with him. After a PoC I got on a project with him and under our corporate flag I've built some data pipeline resulting in a dashboard they now use. Our CEO is not amused (""since no one understands dashboards, 500 pages of crosstabs are just superior"", ...obviously), but can't fire me anymore as the project gets us some decent money and I'm the only one who can handle that.

>ChatGPT is a very intelligent System 1 thinker. It's fantastic at association, which makes its ability to speak eloquently and convincingly on a wide range topics far exceed what we'd expect from its measured IQ (somewhere around 85 depending what test you use). Yet it's very clear that ChatGPT has essentially zero ability for System 2 thinking.

>It has near zero ability for the type of careful consciousness, reasoning or introspection that make human beings such formidable scientists and engineers. No matter how much compute we throw at it, it seems incapable of learning arithmetic beyond two or three digits that it can essentially memorize.

>This is characteristic of the cognitive impairment seen in severe schizophrenia. At a neurological level schizophrenia is closely associated with the degradation of the salience network that powers System 2 reasoning.

I appreciate the intention to help, but this patronizing tone from those who have been in the industry for years along the lines of ""get over yourself and make a resume that'll actually stand out"" isn't helpful and it can be downright hurtful to those who are already in fragile mental states.

I agree with your statement about not hiring anyone without Finance or related experience for your posted positions.  I do the same but for the positions in my industries (retail and manufacturing).  You may ask, ""But how do I get experience in these industries without ... having experience in these industries?""  You can start by reading some books on the topic.  For example, if you're interested in jobs that deal with supply chain, then read up on that.  You may find that you have no interest in it at all!  So a supply chain data science job may not be fun for you.  :(

I also agree with the statement about a Masters degree having more weight compared to Udemy classes for candidates with no experience.

Other advice based on previous open positions I've interviewed candidates for:
- Do not lie about your skillsets.  You can, and likely will, have a technical component to your interview (by someone who has actually done the work before).
- Instead of throwing your data into software/algorithms, be able to understand and explain WHY you are using that particular algorithm to solve the problem
- Be able to work with both new and old types of data. Some companies are still migrating from ""old"" ways of working to new ways (e.g., XML vs JSON and how to parse through both of these).  These types of requirements are likely listed on the job description, including programming languages the company uses, so brush up on these things before your interview."

frd031,flvllnm,121,I think most people would agree that the US response was not good but that metric is a little shaky because you have a true sample of people infected being compared to the highly variable difference in testing capacity for each country. Meaning that the growth alone is only telling you that they were able to test more people over time. This needs to be juxtaposed with other features for sure or compared to theoretically based models of contagion to make any sense.

713hnw,dn87qlw,37,">The name of the school and the operations research degree opened up quite a few doors in the beginning of my (2-year) career, and definitely was a factor in getting an interview, but had nothing to do directly with what was needed for the Data Science job. This is because that offer was contingent on a programming skillset and specific data science problem-solving abilities, of which I had none right after graduation.

The offer may also have been contingent on your education background, you just had that already.

Unfortunately industry trusts grad degree holders more for these roles. Operations Research is going to flag your CV as coming from a candidate that has an optimization and statistics background. The grad degree flags you as someone that can learn more-or-less self directed."

Graduated with a BS in a Math related field from a state school, went into the work force.  
It's been about 15 months since I graduated, my path since graduation (going from company to company) has been...  
•0-2 Months: Job Searching, learning to code, took a coursera  
•2-8 Months: Data Analyst (taught myself Data Science and ML in this time)  
•8-13 months: Jr. Data Scientist (learned more about DS, more field centric experience)  
•13 months - Present: Data Scientist

qwqbxn,hl4fai7,175,"Zillow's initial pilot for this began in either 2016 or 2018 iirc, but they really ramped up their purchases this year. The problem is if you're ""winning"" so many purchases with a bidding algorithm you're opening yourself up to overpay for properties"
qwqbxn,hl4mz6i,328,"People in the company say the model was fairly accurate (or at least with good estimates of intervals), but execs and non-ds teams didn't really follow the recommendations (this often happens in corporate data science) because it didn't suit their goals. Ultimately when shit hits the fan its easier to blame ""the algorithm"" than it is to blame a bunch of different stakeholders getting in the way."
qwqbxn,hl5nt3z,29,Billions + 1 million bounty they paid for the Kaggle competition 🤷‍♂️
qwqbxn,hl6admw,27,"The algorithm had nothing to do with whether this will succeed or fail, this isn't a data science problem but a simple business one, if you're handing out free options, people will take advantage of you.

It's simple theory:

1. Check Zillow for Home Price Value, say X
2. List / Put home out there, if you can't get > X you take X.

Even if your algorithm is very good at estimating fair market value, you're only going to get filled by sellers who cannot find a better buyer. 

The Economic reason why this is doomed to fail:
Any property that Zillow would forecast to find some value in at that price would likely see them being beat by locals who can run tighter (e.g. off books) reno margins and costs.

Zillow's Estimate could have been perfect but being a public company their cost structure is on the books vs in residential construction a lot of is done off books / cash, so any local player could pay more than them for the property but make it back knowing their lower cost structure.

Zillow will only end up with the ones that local reno players do not want at that price.

Opendoor a zillow competitor has a repairs clause where they charge the costs of getting the property into a good state to the seller to effectively force  the property value to coerce to some local benchmark."

qwqbxn,hl5t62i,8,"Its highly debatable that anyone knows from the outside. Sure you can blame the algorithm but it's not like they're using Zestimate for this...

In addition there are a host of factors that could come to play that have nothing to do with 'price prediction'"

kx0ies,gj7qsiz,250,"There is a rather clear shift in the market indeed which can be explained by different factors:

* Data leaders are more educated and now know better what it takes to run a successful data team as they generally have witnessed it or done it in a couple of companies before.
* Those companies realize that the basis of a good DS work is to have the data neatly acquired, processed, modelled, organized and accessible. Doing this right makes the reporting, science and all other downstream parts much easier.
* They also realize that this is a specific skillset and it should not fall on the shoulder of a data scientist but of a dedicated data engineer.
* In parallel, the Data Scientist role starts to be divided into more precise sub roles, some more oriented towards business (business analyst, product analyst, data analyst, BI developer,...) some more towards engineering (ML Engineer, ML Ops, ML Scientist,...). So there are less purely ""Data Scientist"" roles but a bunch of new specialized roles which bring more clarity towards what's actually expected from the professionals.
* Another trend is the greater need for automation and therefore engineering. During years companies/DSs have developed methods to solve some specific problems and some of these tools are becoming standard and can be mostly/fully automated. Therefore, there is a need for more engineering-focused role to do this correctly.

EDIT: Forgot to add: volume of data is also getting bigger with time, so that also generates a higher need for people who actually know how to deal with such volumes."
kx0ies,gj7w468,92,Software engineer here that has been doing data engineering for the past years. For some reason software engineering seems to still pay more than data engineering roles. Also not having to deal with matching table records or semi-manual etl jobs is another plus. I wonder if data engineer salaries will raise in the next years.
kx0ies,gj8a1e5,89,"We also need data scientists that focus on stats ... or .. and this is going to be mind boggling ... we need actual statisticians .

I think the ideal data science team should pair highly experienced and trained statisticians with their counterpart CS/data engineer to solve a DS problem."
kx0ies,gj7nm6x,103,"Deep down we all know this, but the allure of data science to me (and I suspect a lot of people) is from the fact that it's intellectually interesting and the total comp is **really** impressive. When I look at the role of a data engineer and the starting salary... unless there's some significant upwards mobility involved, I'd rather just switch to software engineering."
kx0ies,gj88dpe,9,Always has been. It takes 3x longer to turn a model to production and honestly more challenging but senior leaders will still drool about models 😅 I do both and intend to remain a full stack data scientist

gv3i57,fsmjh7z,38,"Also, ask about what the company considers 'data science'.

Where I work, we have a team of 3 data scientists who just do research stuff and it's up to developers like myself to source the data and deploy the models. So I send the DS folks the data they want and they do their research and send back the model they want me to put into production. 

I wanted to be a data scientist having seen them at work because it's all research and very little data housekeeping, but it turns out that other companies are different. Some places expect data scientists to maintain databases or even gather data themselves which is a lot less fun, so find out who will be doing this stuff before you sign up for it"
gv3i57,fsmty1u,35,"One thing that surprised me when I first started (and to some degree still surprises me now) is how little guidance or structure you get from anyone.  In all likelihood:

\-your manager isn't much more experienced than you

\-or this person is non-technical/an engineer by trade who got corralled into managing you

\-line employees don't know what you really do or how you can help

\-senior execs don't really have a vision or roadmap for data science, they just knew they had to hire people like you for some reason

\-there is no obvious, easy application of DS/ML to your product/operations

\-if there is, people tend to be very resistant to incorporating any change

gv3i57,fsmss2e,23,"I want to share my experience, maybe it would motivate some people:

&#x200B;

I live in Russia (so it could be less relevant for other countries). 4 years ago (or more precisely in August 2016) I have decided to leave my previous job (erp-system consulting, 4 years of experience) and switch to DS. I knew little math, little to no programming and no ML at all.

* it took me \~8 months to get the first job;
* the first job was in a bank. I have build a model to predict customers which will accept an offer of a new bank product. I did it in python, all was okay. When I was told to move the model to SAS, I left the company;
* next was a small startup. I made a small recommendation system based on texts in pyspark, but left the company soon, as the startup was crazy;
* next was a bigger company, but there was almost no ML, only analytics;
* during my free time I studied and practiced a lot - went through courses, made pet-projects, took part in competitions and so on, so people started recognizing me;
* next was a job in a big telecom company, there was a stand-alone department for DS. I got a senior position and worked on a lot of projects there: churn prediction, next purchase prediction, fraud detection and other common ml problems. There were also visualizations, sql ad-hocs of course. But there were also several research projects: graphs on transactions, text analytics, video analytics;
* and now I'm working in another company as a techlead on a project with medical chat-bot (we have some deep learning here);

And still I continue spending a lot of time on improving my skills, learning new things and taking part in Kaggle."

gv3i57,fsmt0x9,9,"Expectations need to be managed and set as realistically as possible before starting a new job - that's what the interviews and company visits are.

Having said that, there are so many companies with different cultures. In my last team we were putting juniors to work alongside seniors on ""cutting-edge"" projects and we were also doing pair programming and mentoring inexperienced people so we can all grow together as a team. 

I guess the point that I am trying to make is: 

If you are financially stable and can afford that don't lower your expectations! Make sure to research the company and their culture. Make sure to ask them what kind of projects are you going to work with and how is your everyday life going to look like. Try to choose a company that has good enough management and seniors which can properly mentor you and help you grow in the direction that you want. It is not a bad thing to discuss this during your interview process and ask them if they have mentoring experience. You should share your career goals and ask how they can help you with that. 

Only lower your expectations if you need to get a job ASAP due to financial reasons or if you have been unemployed for a long time. If that's the case and you sign a contract with a company that you don't really like you should start looking for new jobs that can meet your expectations immediately. 

The fact that someone is junior doesn't mean they should not strive to work on cutting-edge projects. One of the worst thing that can happen to a person professionally is to waste years of their career just waiting for an organization that doesn't have the right management staff or interests to advance their employees careers."
gv3i57,fsmy4eh,8,"tldr; You should watch Office Space before getting into corporate work.  Expectations managed.

As automation and implementation of algorithms improves, there will be less and less need for data scientists at the top end of things (cutting edge ML!  custom tweaking recurrent neural networks!).  Computers will be doing more and more of this work.  ""Oh, but *my* job can't be automated!""  If most of your work is going through a process with clearly defined steps and lots of examples of what should happen as an outcome then chances are good that yes, your job can be automated.  The only question will be whether it is less expensive to automate or to hire a human; expect lower salaries.

But, this predictive analytics beast will need to be fed.  So here's my prediction for data science over the next three decades: 

First, we'll see a decrease of jobs in the ""middle"" tiers of the field; academic/research work will stay steady or increase slightly, and data wrangling, warehousing, and collection related jobs will boom.  

Second, as data wrangling becomes more automated (and as people become better at collecting data in a tidy fashion from the outset), we'll see fewer jobs there, and we'll also see academic research jobs disappearing as the major problems get answered and remaining problems become niche (I'm already in one such niche, you go find your own!).  

Third, as we see the data wrangler on the way out, we'll see the rise of new employment opportunities in data science: 

* the ""data designer"" (or something else without ""scientist"" in the name so that pay can be lower and humanities/social science grads can be hired) whose sole purpose will be survey design.
* the ""data graphics specialist"" ... choosing the color scheme for the plots in the report, and maybe the fonts too, at senior levels.  Yay, art majors!
* the ""data field specialist"" ... door-to-door survey work and follow up calls to get unanswered questions form surveys answered.  Imagine that... ""Hello, I'm calling to follow up on a customer satisfaction survey you answered resulting from your call to customer support for the gas company.  You did not answer question 17 on the survey, and I'd like to follow up with you about that.  This call will be monitored for quality assurance, and you may be asked to take a brief survey at the end about my performance during this call."""

I know I can teach myself anything. That’s basically what all my years of school were for; not an end goal of “knowledge,” but rather a framework for being able to learn and do anything in DS.  But others don’t think this way (see: all job descriptions in DS).  What if the perfect job passes me by because something they need isn’t on my resume?  What if it passes me by because I don’t have a PhD?  Both have happened. It only increases my feeling of incompetence.

This is self inflicted because there are a lot of unrealistic expectations of data scientists and too often nobody stands up or speaks up to change course.  As someone who is older and tougher but still technical I want to be the guy with the backbone.

Sounds great but this is a difficult chore.  Sometimes I lose credibility with the stakeholders or more commonly things change dramatically in the middle of work.  There goes the backbone thing.  Often the stakeholders have expectations that are unrealistic even for kaggle grandmasters.  Political battles are going on all the time.  If I allow myself to get sucked into business drama the team can lose faith in the mission.  Technical people can become demoralized easily.  None of this is new to me in the world of software development.  However the world of data science is growing so fast that even as a tech lead lots of people know more than myself.  Thanks to kaggle and multiple data scientists who trained me I know just a little more than someone with the MS degree.  But the business problems are getting harder in data science and more of them take PhD level skills to crack.  I could talk about feeling imposter syndrome when tech screening people with the MS degree, but that’s nothing compared to confronting an entire team of people who are smarter than oneself about how their work needs changed or improvement for the third time this week while pushing your stakeholders hard to correct their course too.

ltkt9s,gp1slkq,225,"As someone who spends a lot of time using both R and Python about 50/50, here's how it plays out in reality:

- R is better for: tabular data manipulation, data viz, simple models (e.g. OLS).

- Python is better for: *Everything else*, including nontabular data manipulation, neural networks/AI, and most importantly deployment.

*You can do all tasks in both languages*, but usually it comes at the cost of unexpected technical debt if you don't use the right tool for the right job."

     .dropna())

&#x200B;

It surprises me, that people often forget about it.

As for me, I tried using R without Tidyverse of dplyr and didn't like it. I admit that I have heard a lot of good things about them, but in my latest projects working with data frames is only a small part of all the process, so I don't have reasons to do anything in R."

With that being said, Python surpasses R on the potential of high and standardized code quality, ability to develop maintainable and larger data pipelines, and then just other general software engineering principles and flexibility that make your code easier to deploy.

I have my annoyances with both to be honest. For example, one of my pain points with pandas design is that there's so many random ways to perform one simple operation. At least the Tidyverse took care of that with R. My pain points with R is that there are no standardized way to practice good software engineering skills accross developers. If I have to review someone's R code then I'm cringing beforehand. Not because it's bad quality, but because it likely won't be consistent to larger coding principles because everyone uses R differently."
ltkt9s,gp2rpki,17,"Dplyr exists because someone looked at base R’s data manipulation approach and said “I can do better”. At many universities, classes are taught with the tidyverse now. It’s not just that someone created a better tool, it’s that someone created a better tool and it was widely adopted by R practitioners of all skill levels.

There’s nothing stopping the Python community from [taking ideas from dplyr and implementing them in Python](https://github.com/machow/siuba). But what will it take to see a community-wide shift into a data manipulation framework with more intuitive syntax? I don’t want to be mean here —- pandas is a marvel and without it, I’m doubtful that Python would even be used for data science. I use pandas almost every day of the week and I’m immensely grateful to the developers. But there’s always going to be a better approach, yeah?

Imagine a new data manipulation API in Python:

* without any of that indexing stuff
* without any of those axis=1 arguments
* without loc/iloc
* without SettingWithCopyWarning errors
* without the need to quote every column name (likely a limitation of the language)
* with .agg syntax the same as .assign syntax
* with support for list-columns
* with fewer lambdas
* with pivot_wider and pivot_longer
* with tidyselect... oh give me tidyselect please!

What would it take for the Python community to transition to the new syntax much like R did? Whenever I see a new data manipulation framework in Python (eg. Dask) it implements pandas syntax as closely as possible. It genuinely feels like pandas syntax is locked in for Python for the next decade."

i3o4fe,g0cxe1e,40,"I agree interviewers get caught up on algorithms problems when not appropriate for job. That said, I also expect the data scientists to be among the best problem solvers. For my company, the ability to work with graph data is critical. I'm less concerned with implementation quality for problems than how they think about problem (so I prefer live/zoom interview over web-based coding exercise). As an example, we made an offer to a candidate that didn't recognize a DFS graph problem but was able to ask good questions and come up with an equivalent solution with minor code bugs. The thinking was we could trust someone like that to be independent, which is very valuable for a team of our size (<20).

Anyway, I think there are interviewers that ask questions like that for good and bad reasons."
i3o4fe,g0d5wxe,97,"I hate to say it, but there's been enough people coming into the field from outside (particularly academia) and it's becoming obvious that just being good at the stats isn't enough to ensure you can produce what is needed.  

It's very apparent that it's easier to take a software engineer and turn them into a sufficient data scientist/data engineer/machine learning whatever than it is to take someone with great stats/math skills but minimal/less than ideal coding skills and doing the same.  I say this as someone who came into the field with a background in traditional mathematics and no formal coding classes, so I'm really not trying to pick on people here."
i3o4fe,g0dsmul,13,"I'm sorry you've had this experience. The status quo is just awful. I tried to make my hiring process better, but it took months of concentrated effort to design a better DS interview. I don't know how to get the rest of the world to move this way, but personally this is what worked for me -

* I eliminated all questions in the following categories - combinatorics, data structures, algorithms, stats trivia, bayes theorem.
* 50/50 split between technical questions and business case questions. Technical first while the candidate is freshest.
* Technical screen is about problem solving, not syntax. I only choose questions that mirror real-world problems and have a few viable solutions.
* No more than 45 minutes between breaks.
* **This is the most important point** \- I, the interviewer, am up at the whiteboard for business case questions while the interviewee sits. I write down everything they say. This allows me to interact and jam on problems with the candidate without whiteboard anxiety. I've consistently gotten positive feedback on this part of the interview.

I'd love to hear if there are other ideas I could incorporate to make the DS interview even better."
i3o4fe,g0dkpb3,11,"Hm, that's an interesting question. In my experience, many Data Science / ML Engineer positions benefit from algorithmic chops more than general Software Engineer positions. You're much more likely to face dynamic programming while implementing a CRF layer or some post-processing in object detection, than when implementing a CRUD interface using React. You're more likely to face a tree algorithm while working on a clustering problem than while implementing a node.js microservice.

So checking for algorithmic skills can be a reasonable thing for Data Scientist / ML Engineer positions. Not all jobs are like that, but such skills are helpful if a job may require you to go beyond calling library functions. Don't think about Computer Science or Software Engineering as irrelevant. Many advantages in ML only happened because someone was able to combine CS and math knowledge. A lot of the progress in Deep Learning happens because of engineering perfection, not because of careful stats analysis.

Of course, this depends on what you want to work on. The mismatch between interview & job requirements happen often, so you could be right that questions you're being asked are not relevant fo the jobs you're applying to. But be open, for some jobs algorithmic skills are relevant, and some hiring managers may know what they're doing.

Also, the specific way you're being tested may be bad. Timed puzzle solving may not be the greatest proxy for an ability to understand & implement an algorithm from a scientific paper, or for having a good grasp of space & time complexity of various algorithms. This way of testing is bad for Software Engineering positions as well."
i3o4fe,g0dldjf,5,"tbh I don't like the overall dependence on leetcode for software engineering interviews.

However ML engineer is usually a software engineer who works on and deploys ML based software,so those roles with that name would mean you would get tested as a software engineer.

But yes, having it for "" Data Analyst, Data Scientist, "" is out of place."
i3o4fe,g0cqd5x,22,"Generally if an interview does this, it means the hiring manager and recruiter / hr are not in synergy with regards to what the job requires, and what they want an employee to be.
You generally want to avoid this.

It could also be that the hiring manager for that position is totally clueless with what they need. Also want to avoid"
i3o4fe,g0cx0ax,18,"At the end of the day, these coding quiz are rarely ever harder that leetcode 'easy'. While I understand your frustration to some extent, you're probably saving yourself a lot of aggravation by doing 2-3 leetcode problem a week. That's all you need to bridge the gap here. And you'll nail it next time."
i3o4fe,g0d4tle,5,"at least you are Python user, so you didn't have it as bad.  Those websites say they ""support R"" but they don't let you use packages.  It's like telling you to do data science without NumPy and pandas"

Thank you so much for all of your support. Please give me a little bit of time to get everything uploaded from last night. I need to work through a couple of things, get the code pushed to Github, and I will be posting the full VOD in its entirety to Youtube sometime in the next day or two.Additionally, thank you to the moderators for allowing this post.

I know originally I wanted to keep it on Twitch, however, the video will be posted to Youtube. [You can find a link to my Youtube here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWsgeoaCGT9qVg9VhQE8aZQ).

Due to the overwhelming amount of positive feedback, we will be doing this more regularly, however, as more segments (perhaps one stream for EDA, one for model selection, one for tuning, one for insights).

jpljoo,gbg0bsc,25,"I am 5 years in the job right now and I can say that you have learnt a lot in the first year.
 
I just want to add one thing that I learnt. If you have issues acessing data, that needs to become your number 1 priority. Your work will be slow and meaningless and painful until you have a proper data storage dedicated to research, where you can play without risking to impact the production environment."
jpljoo,gbfhxti,92,"Solid advice from what I can tell is a true data scientist. It still is a vast, vague, less-understood field despite the hype around it. I like what you said about stakeholders not even knowing what they truly want. It's the data scientist's job to help visualize the goal for them, too. This is the ""art"" in data science that so many overlook (and therefore struggle with).

Reminds me of the classic example of customers wanting as high as an accuracy as possible in a binary classification, while not understanding the impact of false negatives in a critical situation."
jpljoo,gbfsrdy,21,"I am 18 months into a role as a DataOps engineer, working with big companies' data teams to implement projects, and I would 100% agree!

'Slowing down' a project upfront to ensure everyone actually knows what is needed, what the outputs will be and what assumptions need to be made is incredibly important. Whilst these are decisions that can be guided by the DS, the business experts should be brought into it along the way, which helps to 1) ensure you're not making bad assumptions and 2) avoid the DS basically working in waterfall mode and presenting a 'finished' project 2 months later with no feedback."
jpljoo,gbg8xc2,10,"I can’t tell you how much I agree with your fifth point. It is beyond frustrating when team members only have their code in notebooks and haven’t been pushing to the repo. Having to copy someone’s messy, hobbled together notebook cells into something that makes sense is very difficult, and if it were a script you would just have to import the module instead of recreating a new notebook."
jpljoo,gbg31oy,10,I agree about the notebooks part. Too often Jupyter is recommended as the default environment for data science in Python when really it works best for beginners or tutorials.
jpljoo,gbfvdsj,6,"All valid points, good advice."
jpljoo,gbg00u3,3,"This is a great reflection. any advice on writing unit tests in a DS setting? My code usually consists of ETL functions , preprocessing, modeling, scoring, and writing back out. I’ve never written a unit test and would love some guidance/example."
jpljoo,gbg3qhu,5,"I'm coming up on my 1 year anniversary as a data scientist, and while I disagree on 1, items 2 through 5 are spot on. 

For those here who are new hires, like 1-2 months in, I cannot stress the importance of adhering to items 2-4 enough. The only thing I would add is to set up a few hours on the weekend to do some reading on newer developments in the industry and test out some new models, and libraries/packages/frameworks that you might not use at work just yet. Also, if you mainly use Python, start working with R and if you mainly use R, start working with Python. Each language has its strengths and weaknesses and knowing both will do you good.

If you are still looking for your first DS role, now is a really good time to prioritize item 5. Start making an effort to move away from notebooks unless you're prototyping something, exploring the data or preparing a report. Even then, restructure the code in your notebooks to some extent so you can export it as a .py file which is nearly ready to go into production with some minor tweaking."

Some people here are saying ""oh, it's because professors don't know what the real world is like"" - which is abjectly wrong considering a lot of professors run businesses on the side. 

No, the reason schools focus so much on such a small subset of the work is different - it's because workplaces do not have the time or expertise to teach you that stuff.

Have any of y'all tried teaching someone Linear Algebra on the job? What about Calculus? Probability Theory?

Follow-up: would you feel confident teaching someone those areas from scratch?

The answers are (with few exceptions) no and no.

That is the reason why schools focus so much on that stuff - because it's the only situation in your life where you will have both the time and the talent (professors) to teach you this stuff at the level that it needs to be taught.

1. Track tasks/to-do lists

It really doesn't matter *what* you use but just that you use *something* to stay on top of the work that you need to do and to allow you to breakdown tasks into components. Currently I use Todoist but have used Jira, Google docs, email, etc... I like the ability to write down something broad with a due date (e.g. look into users with missing flag by Wednesday) then when I actually pick it up I can break it out into sub tasks (e.g. define user population, remove the users with a bug, define metrics, etc...). 

2. Pomodoro Focus Technique

There are like a million articles on it but basically at any given moment you cycle through 25 minutes of work with a 5 minute break and then every 3-4 work bursts you take a 15 min break. During this 25 min you are WORKING, hide your phone and do not web browse. Twitter is for the 5 min breaks.

Hell, software engineering is radically different from company to company and team to team. Job title is rarely a perfect signal of actual job.  

The annoying part is that the hiring people don't know how to ask for what they want. Mostly this is because job posts are written by HR/recruiting, who copy buzzwords from other job postings. They don't know that data scientist doesn't always mean data scientist, and they don't know the difference between 'we need an analyst with SQL and BI skills' and 'we need the AI'.

Meanwhile, companies can’t fill vacancies for shit roles, so they title hack to put “data” and “science” in the title to bait applicants. 

Back then, I talked to many people (myself included) who were victims of the hack. In our cases, we applied for and landed DS roles and titles with very DS like demands form up high: ML, data mining, AI, etc. What we found were companies completely unprepared for doing DS.

We all need to get used to the fact that, in data, job titles mean nothing and actual duties and processes are everything."
x7hh75,incjtjb,36,"Same boat. In my 2nd job in a row where they used all the buzzwords to get me in the door and I found out they had no idea what they were doing. Being extremely careful with what I apply to now. Turns out everyone could do with some good SQL experts, but most are years away from getting to any ML."
gf9hrs,fptbvjw,27,"I don't always see eye to eye with things that /u/dfphd posts, but, as a hiring manager as well, this is pretty spot on.

> If the resumes I've reviewed over the last 5 years are any indication, most people seem to think that the answer is a Jupyter Notebook that takes a pretty standard dataset, does EDA, builds a model, and presents a bunch of plots showing quality of fit.

So. Many. Kaggle. Examples. 

Seriously, its almost an instant 'nope' if I see another kaggle housing data set personal project. I've even had a few people show me problems on the iris data set. 

Solve something real and unique, that YOU find interesting, and not just for the sake of solving it, do it because you're passionate about learning and exploration, and because you see an actual gap that can be filled.

Quality post."
gf9hrs,fpsgvln,22,"Totally agree. Being a data scientist is as much about creative problem solving and critical thinking as it is about technical skills. Show the hiring manager that you can pull a question out of the abstract, and then make an interesting explanation for it using your skills. Pick a topic that makes people think, “huh, that’s cool!” The publication “The Pudding” is a good source for ideas like this."
gf9hrs,fps9bon,79,"Awesome write-up, I’m not a hiring manager but I totally agree on this. Don’t just work on a project to build your portfolio, but find a problem that’s actually interesting to you. 

Along with the numerous benefits OP posted above in regard to overcoming challenges (particularly the messiness of data), I personally think passion about a project makes it a lot more valuable when explaining it to an interviewer (and also it’s more fun for you to work on!)."
gf9hrs,fpsy163,12,"This is great. I've hired more than a few junior DS and some analysts and they always have that standard suite of github repos that all have the same stuff. I've always thought that someone taking a real, *new* problem and building out a potential solution or calculator--even without actual data--would go a long way in helping me understand how they think.

I'd love to see someone take a simple problem

> how many push mowers vs. riding lawnmowers vs. manual laborers should a landscaping company have?

then tease apart the data required and simulate it, if possible, then build the tool to show me how to use your model. Doesn't have to be *real* data but take a real problem (or ""opportunity,"" as a previous boss referred to them) that you think a company might have then try and solve it. Don't have any data? Simulate some based upon your knowledge of prob distributions. Make well-reasoned arguments and show me your thought processes behind why.

""Personal projects"" don't have to solve THE BIG business problem just *a* problem. Most importantly, they help hiring managers understand your thought processes. Please, please, **please** don't just take a Kaggle titanic tutorial and `ctrl+c, ctrl+v` into a notebook."
gf9hrs,fpsja82,32,"A somewhat related question:
As someone new to the field (2 years, w/ a B.S.), how can I show what I've done? I currently work in academia with student data, so I can't just throw things up on my private github. 

Also, one thing I keep seeing is that you should build up these extra curricular portfolio, and to me it just seems bonkers - like I'm already overworked, and the last thing I want to do is spend my evening/weekend is fucking around with another data set. I love what I do on a daily basis, but holy shit do recruiters have some high expectations. 

Just had to get this off my chest. I'm tired, sick of applying for 300+ jobs in a pool of 2000 each, and coming to the realization that going to college is not paying off."
gf9hrs,fpue2tz,4,"When I  was a student I did a project where we just used multiple linear regression to predict what end of year season fantasy football points would be so we could form better drafts beginning of season. Hiring managers loved this project example when I went for intern interviews.  They didn't care or understand about our other neural networks project (and now I see why).

We learned all kinds of things that we were seriously lacking before like
Where to get data
How to aggregate and join the data
How do we handle players without previous seasons data
Why are these positions predicting better than these other player positions

And we didn't even build a tool to build weekly lineups or anything.

Basically just saying I agree with OP and it's interesting that I did a very similar project as his example project."

syjt0c,hy3qaic,10,"I can add a bit more info to OP's experience, so that it all can be in one thread.  
  
Background: 8 years industry experience in ML/DS (6 years post-PhD), PhD in STEM with loads of ML, few papers with high impact and couple of patents. Looked at jobs in Germany that allow me to work remotely (I am moving to a small city, so remote work is important for me). I just started the process, so I don’t have too much useful info here  
  
**Wolt:**  
**Position:** Senior DS   
**Process:** 1 hr HR talk, 1.5 hrs hiring manager interview, a big take home task, tech interview and final stakeholder interview.   
**Experience**: First two rounds were way easy. I bombed the tech round (the blame is on me mainly, I just prepared an hour before the interview and that wasn't good enough to answer the probability questions they asked me). Take home was given by HR, so no idea what the tech-team was interested in seeing. I spend a lot of time on making the code beautiful, have a proper documentation etc - unfortunately, they didn't care about any of it. They weren't happy with some of the assumptions I made on imputing etc, and we couldn't agree on those topics. There was an SQL question on a mock table, the simple answer wasn't satisfactory for them (they wanted me to use window functions). All in all very chaotic interview and by the end I knew I wasn't going to get an offer from them.   
Lesson Learned: Prepare well, doesn't matter your experience or day to day work etc, prepare to answer all the common interview questions. Also, try to answer what the interviewer want to hear - if there is an SQL question, most probably they are looking at window functions etc.  
**Salary**: Market standard :P  
  
**Delivery Hero:**  
**Position:** Senior DS   
**Process:** 45 mts HR talk, 1 hrs hiring manager interview, 2 hrs Coding in Codility and more.  
**Experience:** First two rounds were easy, didn’t do the Codility and dropped out from the process as I wasn’t super keen on the process.  
Salary: Approx 100k  
  
**A Big Chemical Manufacturing Company:**  
Don’t want to name them as that will expose my location.  
**Position:** Senior DS   
**Process:** 45 mts hiring manager interview, \*two\* take home assignments, half day interview (tech+stakeholder)  
**Experience:** I liked the hiring manager, but I was so furious about the two take home assignments, so I didn’t proceed further. They weren’t happy to look at my github or other take home  
**Salary:** Approx 90k+  
  
**ING**  
**Position:** Senior DS   
**Process:** 45 mts HR talk, 1.5 hrs tech interview with the hiring manager + a senior DS, take home and then a stakeholder interview.  
**Experience:** The most pleasant interview I ever had. Hiring manager was very nice and they knew it is too much to ask for a take home, and they wanted to do that to candidates whom they like hence the tech round first. I didn’t proceed further as they required me to move to Amsterdam  
**Salary:** Approx 85k  
  
  
**Shopify, CashApp, Revolut :** No response  
  
**Facebook, Spotify:** Second round is yet to happen

&#x200B;

A few others is going on, I may update this with my experience with them as well.  
  
NB: I must say that I still am not prepared well for these interviews due current workload and family commitments etc (and no LeetCode either). I hope to find a place that will suit me and won't be asking me to sacrifice my first born or a recommendation letter from Pope"

syjt0c,hy029ss,6,What is your PhD in?
syjt0c,hy0z8ti,6,I'm sorry if this question comes of as a little lazy or unprofessional but I've been wondering: with the amount of companies you've applied to - how comprehensive is the work you put into each application? Reason I'm asking is that I've recently picked up that these days some companies don't care about cover letters for example. Which - at least for me - used to be what usually took me the longest to customize for each application while adjusting your resume to include the relevant buzzwords is usually a quick process. So long story short - do you even bother writing custom cover letters or is that something most tech companies don't care about anyways?

It also helped with more informal conversations that happened during the year with my managers. And, ultimately, it helped my shape my CV and recommendations letter when I started job hunting.

At the end of each project (it could range form a couple of weeks to a couple of months), I wrote down:

* What was the project about
* What I delivered
* What was the impact
* What I did well in the process
* What could have been done better

The last point is also important as it helps you understand where there is room for improvement, which also is something you will cover with your manager or during interviews. The best is if you can show how you identified some improvement areas in a past project and how you acted upon it during the following projects.

An other important point is to not focus only on the tech side but also consider human or project management aspects such as mentoring, stakeholder management,... They are as important as the tech aspect of things when it comes to individual progression"

Also try to include business value statements in your brag - did it increase revenue or sales, reduce risk or cost, introduce efficiency etc...  this too will do wonders for your career.

h96nz8,fuwjx2p,6,"Outstanding post.

Consider taking time to congratulate someone on your team in the form of a written ""I see what you did there"" comment. It doesn't have to be much. Just a sentence or two. Take time to put it on a small card. Avoid email if you can. 

Our teammates are often not given positive feedback, especially in written form and this will really change the dynamics of the team. It builds respect. 

When I worked at a corporate & investing bank I did this on a regular basis. On my 10 year anniversary, just before my departure, I walked around to say goodbye to friends and colleagues.

uo589a,i8cut6w,337,"Ok kids, sit down and grab some popcorn.

If you haven't noticed, I am infamous for writing long posts, and this may or may not be a long one, but it's one of the topics that I am the most opinionated on in corporate America. It's one of my biggest pet peeves as someone who manages people, and who is responsible for evaluating, hiring, and retaining people.

TL;DR: There are two reasons why companies spend more money hiring than retaining people:

1. Because it's more cost effective to do so if you don't put any value on productivity, knowledge, or performance.
2. Because HR departments are self-serving and they generally ignore the value of productivity, knowledge, or performance in order to highlight the cost savings generated by their strategies.

Longer version:

When you are an HR department, you are a cost center. That is, you do not generate any revenue. As a result of that, your main way to justify your existance (other than to keep up with regulatory requirements), is to save the company money.

How do you save the company money? By keeping it's biggest operating cost in check - payroll. At most companies, payroll is the biggest slice of the cost pie that isn't cost of goods. And because of that, HR ends up being pretty important: if HR can cut costs by 5%, that could be up to 1% of the entire company's budget for the year. Big money.

Now, something to know about HR: they're not generally well versed in math, modeling, numbers, etc. They know enough to calculate things that are directly calculatable, but when it comes to things that are harder to quantify... they're not going to try.

So what is easy to quantify? That if decreasing the budget for raises by $1M increases  attrition by 20 people in a year, and it costs $30K to fill each one of those roles, then I just saved the company $400K. Boom, cash money.

And so the way this plays out mechanically is that if there are 100 employees that deserve a raise, and you give 5 of them a decent raise, this is what will happen, out of the remaining 95:

* 20 or so will think ""I just need to try harder"", because they're naive.
* 40 or so will be mad, but not motivated enough to do anything about it
* 20 or so will be mad, look for other jobs, but not immediately find something better, get discouraged and stay
* 15 or so will be mad, look for other jobs, get something better eventually, and out of them, you'll be able to retain half with a good counteroffer.

That is the gamble that HR plays.

There are three fundamental problems with that gamble:

**It does not account for the asymmetry of who you lose.** The 7-8 people you will lose are almost surely your absolute best people. So when you perpetuate this cycle, you are continuously skimming off the top of your talent pool - which is not who you want to lose. Because the people that you hire to replace them are unlikely to be as good.

**It does not account for everything else you lose when someone leaves**. Other employees have to pick up the slack, which leads to burnout. That person that left knew a lot of things, and probably connected different people/departments/concepts/systems and you have now lost that. There are probably relationships that are now damaged. The amount of time it takes you to replace them is all lost productivity. And these are all things that HR, quite frankly, doesn't even pretend to care about. Why? Because it's not their fucking problem. They're not going to deal with the extra workload - you, the manager and coworkers of the person who left are. They're not going to get dinged for the fact that your team wasn't able to hit a release date, or a project deadline. You are.

**The terms of that equation are changing**. It used to be that most people were willing to suck it up, work harder, grumble, but stay. And that is changing. This is what the great resignation is - a realization that there are other jobs out there right now that *will* pay you more *today*. Not in 6 months after you do a bunch more shit. Also, not a 3% raise. A 25% raise today to go do almost the same goddamn job. The great resignation isn't a new process, it's just changing probabilities on a calculated gamble by HR departments that is exposing their scam.

What can you do about it?

My friends are tired of hearing me talk about this, but it's super simple: if you've been through one yearly performance management cycle at your job, and you got a raise that seems shitty compared to the work you put in, or if you think you're underpaid - start applying to other jobs. And just see what happens.

Maybe you find out that your are being paid market value - in that no one will pay you more. And that's fine, then you can work while being assured that your company is at least paying you what you're worth.

Maybe you find that other companies are willing to pay you a bit more money, in which case you can use it as leverage - if not for a higher salary, for better working conditions. And mind you, you don't need to explicitly say ""do better or else"". You can just say ""do better"", and if they don't - leave.

And maybe, just maybe, someone out there is willing to pay you 20%, 30%, 40% more than what you're making today. And letting you work remote. And giving you better benefits. And more responsibility/clout. And if that happens, you thank everyone at your last job, pack your bags, and leave.

**One last note on HR, and this is the super extra cynic in me:**

One last interesting observation: recruiting is normally a part of HR. So what other effect does attrition have? A higher need for recruiters. So, in enabling higher attrition for the company in the name of cost savings, not only does HR justify it's worth through the cost savings, but then can double down on the back-end and justify its need to grow due to all the open positions they need to fill with recruiters."
uo589a,i8cjy5r,96,"Reason #3: If I have to hire one new person today, and I thought I was going to pay $100k, and it turns out that all qualified candidates require $130k, then I have to find $30k in the budget to be successful.

If I simultaneously have 20 existing employees in the same role and they all make $100k, I need to find $600k in the budget to retain them all by paying the market wage.

One of these things is much harder than the other. It's more expensive to lose them for sure, because I'm going to then have to pay at least the market rate to replace them, but that doesn't make $600k magically appear in my budget either. Hence why people end up having to make noise to get a raise. I probably can't solve the entire problem at once, and the people less likely to leave get treated as the less urgent target."
uo589a,i8cfzib,16,"I completely agree with your post and the recommendations. If you don't ask, they'll assume you are happy. In my case, I got 16% simply for asking, but my timing was perfect.

uo589a,i8cl37z,10,"Also a lot of people on this sub seem to think if you make six figures you have made it and should just be happy. They also assume any other growth in salary comes with worst WLB or more responsibility 

A) Salary is based on what the combination of the market and what you negotiate makes it. Notice nothing there about WLB or responsibilities.

B) You can leave your six figure job for another higher paying one without having a worst WLB or more responsibilities. You just need to be discerning"
uo589a,i8dg1v4,3,"In my experience, when a manager is faced between something urgent vs something important, they will alway opt to address the urgent thing.  Typically budget and delivery timeframes is the urgent problem, so retention of existing staff is not something they think about.  Retention only becomes an urgent problem if lots of people start leaving."

I think a more usual way of evaluating my candidacy would instead be to use 30-60min to sit down with a DS to discuss the nuances of my approach and how my work experience provides me with the best way to solve this problem given current resources and information.""

seufwd,hultzde,41,"I've started saying no to companies that require a take home rest. I noticed that they don't really give any feedback, it's usually a 'Yes we can proceed to the next round' or 'No' but no rationalization, which makes it hard for me to figure out what I'm doing right/wrong. The take home case studies are usually open ended and take at least 4-6 hours. 

I've also had questions like ' Convince me that this sport is completely random and not based on skill'. I was pretty nervous and blanked out and ended up saying random things."
seufwd,hulm937,242,"When I last interviewed for a new job late last year I just didn't bother with any complicated interview process.

edgai0,fbhthi1,28,"This is excellent advice and pretty spot-on in my experience. I started my interest in data science by using it to solve a problem in a chemical plant setting. Interest and financial investment in my efforts can largely be attributed to results-driven communication. In most presentations or discussions about my work, I would:

1) State the results outright first.

2) Briefly explain how the results were verified so that everyone has more confidence.

3) Chart a realistic timeline for more results as the project develops. This built trust.

4) Present clear financial expectations (ex. ROI)

5) A very brief, high level overview about where the technical design was heading.

6) Open the floor or room for questions. Invite them to ask about the ""technical weeds"" of the project.

edgai0,fbi34q4,8,"I see your points, but I think I'm going to disagree a bit.

Imo, my job absolutely is about being right. Being right has value. Being right, is the value. But I think the difference here is about what one means by right.

I just don't accept the implicit assumption that there is ONLY ONE right way, that only one person can be right, or that a solution could possibly be valid if it does't work.

There are often multiple solutions to any given problem. Two people can have vastly different approaches to solving a problem. And different approaches can be perfectly valid, though not necessarily obvious in their correctness.

Also, invalidating another persons approach is a waste of time and makes you kind of an asshole anyway. I think if you start with that, the rest follows rather naturally.

However, pointing out that an approach does not meet all the criteria required of the solution, that has value for everyone. But this entails a well defined problem, the solution of which should have well defined constraints, typically having to do with the time and resources required to implement the solution.

And if the problem is not well defined, then no solution can be said to be the right one. When this happens, the problem itself needs further investigation.

To me, this is what being right means:

1. Identify the gap in regards to business objectives.
2. Define the various constraints for implementing a solution - with input from management/team.
3. Do research and bring to the table multiple solutions ""to discuss"" that might satisfy the problem set. And listen to the input/feedback of others.
4. Implement what seems like the ""best"" solution - based on consensus, or direction from management, or my own choice, depending on the responsibility that is assigned to me.

If I do all that, then I'm right. If another solution is better than mine, or otherwise selected over mine, that doesn't make me wrong. Being right is doing my job right. And my job is working with other people. That's why having a good attitude and focusing on trying to find the ""best"" solution and not the ""right"" solution, is the right way forward.

In response to some of those corollaries.

* It's right, IF and Only IF:
   * it works and meets the requirements
   * it can be implemented within the defined constraints
* Often, you only know if something is going to work after you try it.
* If it seemed like a good idea, you/they tried it, and it didn't work, it was not wrong to try it.
   * There is always a level of acceptable risk that must be agreed to.
* If it does work, there still maybe a more right way to do it.
   * Tackle that next iteration. That's called Refactoring =)

dnmlyz,f5czrct,56,"""I need some data""
""Okay, what are you trying to solve?""
""I don't know, just give a dashboard or something""
Reasons why I got frustrated and am now trying to focus on the bottom of the pyramid."
dnmlyz,f5d2o96,135,"The executive mentality regarding DS is best summed up by *South Park*'s Underpants Gnomes: 

* Step 1. Data
* Step 2. ???
* Step 3. Profit

A large number of executives, perhaps even a supermajority, neither know nor care about what their business is actually about. What they know is corporate politics: networking, self-promotion, finding scapegoats for their bad decisions, and stealing credit for other people's good ones. That's how one gets to a leadership position in any large organization of human beings.

The best you can hope for is someone like Elon Musk, an executive type who has a nonzero knowledge of how to effectively use technical people.

The only reason so many CEOs are interested in ""data science"", which is really applied statistics with a big dash of software dev and data visualization thrown in, is because the FAANG companies together make up 12.6% of the S&P 500's total market value.

Because those companies rely on data scientists, these CEOs think that they need data scientists in order for their own companies to achieve similarly high stock valuations. It's a case of monkey see, monkey do.

What they fail to understand is that the FAANG companies have a very clear idea of what they want to do with data. They think very hard about how to collect it, how to store it, how to process it, what kinds of analyses they want to perform on it, what they want to do with the results, and how to communicate the results to stakeholders. And even those companies have difficulty finding out how best to use data.

Without such a holistic, end-to-end understanding of how data science is integrated into the business model, a business's attempt to ""do data science"" is likely to go awry. It is not enough to hire a few PhDs and software engineers and tell them to start generating value for the company. 

Of course, when this half-assed, shambolic, doomed-to-fail effort at implementing a DS operation goes awry, the executives will not blame themselves for their ignorance. CEOs do not become CEOs by admitting error, or through introspection. They get there by promulgating a myth of infallibility.

They will do what got them to the top: look for a fall guy, and blame the skilled technical people whom they hired and then so spectacularly misused.

I am not sure how this situation will remedy itself. Small companies will have to start out doing data science the right way, and then grow large and powerful to beat the big, established companies at their own game, as in the Netflix-Disney saga of streaming TV. 

Most executives don't care about a technical person's suggestions to improve the business; they view technical people as hired help. They see no difference between an accountant and a PhD in deep learning from Stanford CS. It's the same thing to them. 

They do care when a technically superior competitor threatens to put their company out of business, because then they might lose their own jobs. And then, when the situation becomes that dire, then they might listen to a technical person's suggestions on how to integrate DS into the business.

To create a data science culture at a large company which doesn't have one, you have to develop your own company which effectively utilizes DS and kick their ass so thoroughly and publicly that they're forced to imitate you. That's what happened with Disney and Netflix. 

That's the only thing that changes anything in business."
dnmlyz,f5datzm,16,"The bottom of the pyramid is a career in itself. One that is marginally more complicated than DS in the first place. And there are a large proportion of shonks in both industries.

Good luck to all of you."

dnmlyz,f5cz9gn,9,You can carve yourself out a nice career in data if you focus on the bottom of that pyramid.
dnmlyz,f5f9i3p,3,"I'm not sure if I agree. I'm doing some of the stuff in all the levels from two to 5 (ML) on this pyramid, limited to the department I work in. Hence I don't need ""org-alignment"" or breaking ""silos"" and obviously makes some of the other levels easier. All I need is buy-in from my boss to spend time in this and some level up for some money on soft and hardware. I mean most stuff is free and open source and if you are not doing deep learning, hardware wise you can get very far with just $5000 or so.

In fact I question the whole pyramid as it assumes data science must be an top-down, org-wide thing centrally organized. I'm challenging that view especially for companies that are not tech companies. In such companies it can be ""locally"" grown within different departments/divisions and having the data scientists sit and work directly with the end-users. bottom-up approach. Much more efficient IMHO. Yeah you are not going to do some fancy bleeding edge AI stuff that way, but as said, that is not the core business anyway.

The bigger challenge is user-buy in and user-expectations which seems to be heavily polarized between ""believe it alls"" and ""complete resistance"". Too little and too much skepticism. If you manage one side you make the other side worse."
dnmlyz,f5cwz8q,16,"The problem is execs are 50+ years old and barely comprehend computers let alone data science. Many of them fundamentally see it as a fad they need to do to be relevant, rather than something they need to put together an actual strategy for. They throw a VP to ""integrate AI throughout the organization"" who also has no experience, and then they somehow expect everything to just work because their model of business is at a top level thermodynamic level where they merely see costs and expect revenue.

That pyramid is going to topple soon. There's going to be a rampant algorithm that puts the Equifax security breach to shame. It will be something that a company can't simply write off.

I'm quite tired of the argument that ""executives need buy in"". That's a garbage statement. At some point you need executives with experience to either lead, or select good leaders, and they insist on doing neither. Real buy in is an executive, or an executive that selects another person, that can at bare minimum finish the Ng intro Coursera course. I have only met a single company that has that, and they were an ML SAAS company."

- If you are bothered by the low standard of coding with the DSs, that is worth a rant but has nothing to do with notebooks. It sucks for you that you're in a place where DSs don't at least make well organized code to pass to engineers.

- At the end of the day your job is to take wonky prototypes written by people who are worse than you with code but better with data and turn it into a properly engineered code base. If you don't enjoy that, maybe you want to be a traditional software engineer?"

Today of course it's quite the opposite.  In 2020 21% of data scientist have a computer science degree.  Companies hiring for data scientists are now hiring for applied machine learning engineer skillsets and so many companies want their data scientists to have data engineering skills.

okscnp,h59v8tg,31,Would be interested to know what stuff did you automate exactly
okscnp,h5a0cxa,23,"Automating most of your job away is a positive skill. We're in a field that is developing quickly and that requires growing knowledge of changing technologies and ideas. You can spend down-time working on:  


\-Statistics  
\-Programming skills  
\-Info security  
\-Documentation  
\-Training materials  
\-New data-related applications (create a frontend for your database!)  
\-Cloud integration  
\-Warehouse storage/compression  
\-Network security  
\-Less-traditional data but still good-to-have IT/SysAdmin skills, like PowerShell  
\-Six Sigma and/or IIBA certifications  
\-A whole lot more that I didn't think of immediately  


and still claim that you're working.  


But there's more to work than working and learning.   


Here's a fact of working in data: sometimes you'll have down weeks, other times you'll work 14 hour days (yesterday I worked from \~4AM to \~9PM (with lots of reddit time and a couple meals built into that schedule -- probably 12 hours of actually getting work done) because we are up against some deadlines and I'm spearheading some data analysis/engineering changes all while being on every imaginable committee that even has the essence of the word 'data' in my organization and field). Make sure you don't accidentally give yourself too much to do, because 14 hour days can quickly turn into 20 hour days if your normal workload is 6 hours more per day.  


Also, don't forget that data is a field where you can sometimes get stuck in your brain. You're in no small part an ideas person. Intellectual workers tend to need more *disperse mode* brain time. That is, time when your brain is not explicitly focused on problems. The brain can only take so much before draining, becoming fatigued, or becoming depressed and/or anxious. Various Google sources say that anything more than 4 hours of focused work a day is pushing it, while a few prominent studies push this number to 5 or 6 (with generous breaks, so probably still closer to 4 at most).  


And a secret: naps are *great* for problem-solving. I think Barbara Oakley, the brilliant Systems Engineer and author of *A Mind for Numbers*, has one of the best compilations of research on diffuse mode thinking and sleep. I WFH most of the time (virtually all of the time since COVID started -- I haven't been to the office since December 2019!) and am lucky to have a bed in my home office (it doubles as a guest room). When I know I have 15 minutes of undisturbed time and I'm feeling stuck or exhausted or bored (all of which point to potential burn-out), I let myself have a very quick powernap. My productivity usually doubles or triples for the next couple hours after a very short nap, so I don't really feel guilty about doing it.  


Finally, if you're experiencing burn-out and your boss is safe to talk to, mention it. Sometimes, ""Yo, you have vacation hours, use them!"" is exactly what we need to hear.  


Good luck!"
okscnp,h5bumgs,22,"Yeah.  Very normal. 
I built code which sped a simulation up by a factor of about 100.   We used to do 5 runs in a day.  Now we do 500 runs in a day. 

My company’s payroll dept keeps screwing things up.  Like about every 4th paycheck is jacked.  I asked the cfo what was going on, and he complained about having to cut and paste spreadsheets.  Manually.  And I tried to explain to him that this could be automated and streamlined.  And he pretty much told me to fuck off. 

A lady I work with was tasked with renaming a nested directory structure containing hundreds of thousands of files.  Boss told her to find all files with “bob” in the file name and replace with “Steve”.  I tried explaining that we could build a script to do this.   And it would take maybe a day.

Unpopular opinion: Data science job posts do not post enough information of what the projects are and what kind of work they need done.  Instead they write a bunch of fluff about communication skills, or broad technical skills like knowing R.  Then you have to apply to every data science job post you run across where only a fraction match your skill set.  No wonder why companies are flooded with so many resumes.

I deeply specialize as many senior data scientists and research scientists do.  Not to say I'm not a generalist either, but what I specialize in is rare.  Less than 1 in 100 data science jobs want me because they're not looking for another kind of specialization, but of the few that do, they *really* want me.  Problem is, I have to apply to every job post out there to find those companies, and it sucks.  Data science job posts should have more hard details in them than they currently do.

My current job, the company posted actual project details of what they needed.  In response they had the job post open for an entire year and I was the first person to apply (in silicon valley no less).  This is for a data science role, so you'd think they would be flooded with applicants.  It's amazing what putting in what you're actually looking for does.  Imagine if they didn't do that and they had to interview for a year+, tens of thousands of applicants, to find someone who fits.  And on the other end, I probably wouldn't have interviewed with them if I didn't see those finer details in the job post.  Companies are struggling to find good fits and imo it's entirely their fault."

if you feel that you are just doing data analyst work, realise that you are in the middle of a manual and adhoc data pipeline. the data you analyze is presented to someone who extracts insights from your graphs and charts to make decisions. if all you do is get the moving average of sales and you find that management looks at the moving average and assumes future sales will be along the current trendline of the moving average and makes decisions that way, then take initiative and get the accuracy of that adhoc model. pitch a plan to management that you need to collect data to verify how often their decision making is correct so that we can know what sort of risk we are taking and if we can make better predictions. and do some EDA on that same data to see if theres a slightly better model to be cranked out quick (dont spend too much time on this baseline model). make sure that by the end of your project you show management that you have saved them money by making predictions even slightly more accurate. they might still want to verify your prediction manually but they will value you from now on. then your on your way to automating the pipeline you were a cog in.

now obviously if your management shuts you down for no good reason then thats a different story, but these days management would not dare shy away from something that sells as easily as data science, especially if you can get the rest of your work done in time and so they have little cost to pay for it"

And also do companies still want to hire someone without PhD to be a data scientist?

I think that as technology grows, the role of a data scientist has become more vague. In one company, the data scientist responsible from end-to-end data science project with mostly dealing with data engineering stuff (since 80% of the work comes from that). This requires data engineering skills, such as Spark, Hadoop, SQL, and pipelining techniques in designing the data lake to be then used for modelling.

In an ideal world (such as Disney) a data scientist will focus more on modelling (please CMIIW) which will requires more maths and stats, but since the day-to-day activity revolves around that, as days goes by, the data scientist will getting better and better and more getting a hang on what to do as a data scientist.

In other company, a Data Scientist is also responsible for deployment of the model, which requires more software engineering skills, including cloud, containerisation, CI/CD, and model monitoring (like data drift monitoring).

My point is that I am getting overwhelmed with all of these tech stacks and at the same time have to master maths and stats (which is very, very hard). What's your opinion/recommendation for this?

Thank you for your time."

Graduation is still 2 months away and historically we have close to a 100% job placement rate by graduation. My experience going through the process (again, just speaking from what I've seen, may not be true) is that entry-level data science roles are for the most part (>90%) filled by candidates from the following hiring streams:  
>  
>Internal moves within the company (for example an SWE who has an interest in ML/DS and took MOOCs or got work exp to pass the internal interviewing process)  
>  
>Bootcamps with high prestige/track records of success (Insight data science is one that comes to mind but is specific to PhDs). I've heard insight isn't as good anymore so my info here might be outdated

Now, I've had roles open for a junior resource for a while and I haven't been able to fill it.

The common patterns I've seen when interviewing are:

* Misaligned background: Cool that you did a bachelor of arts and can make pretty graphs but in my case that's not what I'm looking for.
* Missing core concepts: You took Stats 101 and think that qualifies you to be a data scientist; however, you cant define what a correlation is or identify the challenges of a non-normal distribution
* FAANG: Not every company is FAANG, there are good-sized companies with real Data Science challenges; however, we want to hire someone who is not just using us as a stepping stone so you can get your experience and move somewhere else. We want to invest in you so you can invest in us. what they did and how, then hit a wall when follow-up critical-thinking, statistical-thinking questions are asked. Also, there are other industries besides tech that might not be as sexy but still need data scientists.
* Unrealistic expectations: You have zero experience but want to make 150k plus bonus, stock, benefits, flexible time, etc. Or you might have years of experience in a non-related field and want us to consider that as part of your experience when making you an offer.
* Communication: You might be the brightest data scientist in the world but if you can't communicate it to me during an interview I won't be able to tell. Even if I was able to tell I'd have to think hard if that communication gap is worth having your brain on board. This makes things challenging because many of us tend to be more introverted
* Visa: There are some companies that will not do sponsorships of visas. Period. So if you need one that will already shrink your pool.
* Competition: I've had 2 candidates who have accepted our offer just to withdraw themselves (3 days and 5 days) before their starting date. Just because they got a last minute offer somewhere else.

* use at least 100 trees (n_estimators I think?), RF doesn't really over fit 

Done, you now have a good baseline. You can do some quick things to improve

What's really bizarre about it is that I strongly suspect that the vast majority of those people are actually copying one poorly done version of that project from years ago. Not directly. It's like a chain letter. One cohort does the original copying, then they all put their copies on github, then later cohorts find those copies and copy them.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language

That is, ""regular expression"" refers to the ability to match patterns that are themselves ""regular languages"", and a ""regular language"" is one that can be recognized by a finite state automaton. This is a useful property, because it means that it's straightforward to generate an efficient parser/recognizer for the language.

Not only can she liaise with business partners, she can design experiments, analyze them correctly,  productionalize her deep learning models, and then spin up infra for MLOPs.  No, what in the actual fuck, no.  Have a team of people.  Have someone who comes from a quant background, someone who comes from a business background, someone who comes from an engineering background etc.  Why the hell are constantly making proclamations on what a data scientist should be?

- do the people on this team have non quantitative backgrounds or some non analyst / scientist background?            

It is honestly insufferable to work with a team who is homogenous (all stats PhDs / masters) or all from the same cultural values / have no experience bridging cultures / values / communication styles. One of my coworkers is so rigid and pedantic it’s exhausting and she can’t zoom out to the big picture if the model hasn’t been validated / completed perfectly every time.

Some things I do believe are very helpful; an interest and domain knowledge in the area you’re working, an ability to learn 90% of some new technique / technology quickly (enough to meaningfully understand how it’d be used), an ability to prioritize good results and iteration over technical perfection, and curiosity and humility.

You can chill and just fill your time with other things, which honestly if you're getting everything done they ask of you, producing quality work, and available for meetings as needed is basically fine (maybe somewhat unethical, but even that's arguable). If you do this you're in a really bad position if the company needs to reduce costs, you're very exposed to layoffs. The other thing you can do is tell your boss you're underutilized and bring some ideas for other places you could add value and try to really invest in the goals of the firm with the aim of moving up in the company. Definitely harder work, but safer both at your current company and in the event you need to find a new job (since your resume will be more impressive). Really up to you, I've done both at different periods of time.

One word of caution: I've managed quite a few people who I knew were skating by, but because it's such a pain in the ass as a manager to get rid of people it's often easier to just focus on your more important work and let those people coast for some period of time. But that's dangerous because if managers do get asked to cut costs those are the first people to go and you might not have any real prior indication. Shit happens fast when Finance brings down the budget hammer. Just don't assume everything is hunky dory just because you haven't gotten called out, it doesn't mean your management doesn't know you're underutilized."

2. all horizontals/functions/practices i.e. supply chain, finance, marketing and sales, HR…
