would share question since many people subreddit looking jobs. hope help someone background currently work d 1.5 year work ex data analytics field. initially hired da interview based sql quite easy c undergrad . later got promoted d position faced serious technical d interview today. technical question asked 1. would go predicting hotel price company like booking.com previously worked similar company business analyst hence question. able answer based work done there. 2. let u say categorical column 500 categories. would tackle answered use catboost us catboost target encoder would help convert categorical value numerical value rather going one hot encoding. mentioned want use linear regression said use target encoding method like james stein encoder catboost encoder preferred tackle target leakage . answer right way seem 100 convinced 3. would check weight feature decision tree said look feature importance feature. asked feature importance 100 mean feature influence target 100 replied see shap value understand influence feature target honestly researched enough comment further. 4. use k mean categorical data use one hot encoding convert categorical data numerical using k mean euclidian distance binary column make sense would use k mode rather k mean categorical data 5. choose number cluster k mean use elbow method silhouette score explained method 6. let u say use silhouette analysis customer segmentation exercise get k 30 optimal number clusters. cannot show 30 cluster business said generally customer segmentation would need business input well practical number segment according business replied 5 10 said well 5 10 cluster whichever highest silhouette score chosen. know right answer 7. difference b w k mean k mode said categorical data use k mode finding mode particular category accurate make sense rather converting category binary value using distance algo like k means. 8. would perform customer segmentation ott platform panicked one honestly said age gender nationality probably genre show watch show completely long member ott platform yes ik make sense like said panciked 9. think mentioned factor good representative customer lifetime value uhh idea customer life time value mean winged one 10. one independent variable arima answered yes vaguely remember coming across 100 sure. 11. difference b w arima arimax arimax arima also exogenous variable help identify surge like holidays. 12. would use arima prophet time series read article say properly tuned sarima would outperform prophet answered 13. would tune arima finding best parameter value p q 14. p q arima forgot represent tried answer whatever could recall p no. previous lag consider q forgot difference 15. exactly said represents seasonality pattern realize seasonality sarima arima. ugh 16. pas non stationary data arima assumption t data stationary constant mean variance assume pattern future value well 17. check data stationary plotting first accurate way use dickey fuller test confirm 18. choose 10 new hotel onboard booking.com said look number booking location accessibility metro bus near tourist spot review stars. 19. model recommended 10 new hotel onboard area x add constraint fix even know topic question said maybe modify cost function adding variable penalize cost function based number hotel suggests belong area maybe add constraint cost function 20. add constraint cost function becomes non linear optimization problem would use linear programming solve idea lol 21. difference b w segmentation clustering answered segmentation use

datascience,uo589a,company willing spend much hiring new employee retaining,ibsurvivors,2022-05-12 16:37:51,Career,632,0.97,april 2021 got 40 raise. pretty big raise. make feel good. fact made realize leaving money table almost two years. would never got raise unless fought it. unless typed email stuck neck demanding worth. experience taught important lesson retention measure like pay raise reactive proactive. company feel happy pay more. post going tell data back case it. start like content related growing tech career might like newsletter best content delivered inbox every two weeks. cheer salary compression salary compression happens company raise employee salary pay higher wage attract new talent. imbalance spending new hire existing worker resulted historic pay compression gap wage 20 24 year old reliable proxy new hire 25 34 year old shrunk smallest size 36 years. actually tends impact tech industry others tldr employer giving way money new hire compared existing employees. pretty surprising considering cost replacing someone high. company 1. absorb hiring cost 2. search competitive market talent 3. distract team member another round interview 4. deal onboarding cost lack productivity first three month new hire happen two possible reason possible reason 1 retention effort take time solid retention effort policy type initiative hard measure work long period time like 5 10 years. often thing cannot prioritized hypergrowth nature tech industry. investor want see result now. company spend lot time effort pay least amount money per role. take pride that. much easier bring new people in. unfortunately think right way think world want great company. possible reason 2 career ladder strategy developed one common thing happens especially high growth startup workload increase beyond task original role salary change. defining internal career growth ladder actually quite time consuming. well defined real precedent get raise. case even case company want give raise done work establish next step look like. mean first need realize salary one element total compensation package. lot factor negotiate outside base compensation. quick list

enjoying work focus became salary. got raise wanted realized staying wrong reasons. think raise going solve job satisfaction problem keep mind probably not. deserve get paid worth. time change that. three principle keep mind negotiating raise principle 1 evidence identify top two accomplishment last 6 8 months. pick one quantifiable impact. ammunition. present info however want make easy possible bos vouch you. make unnecessary work ideally literally forward evidence presented via deck document higher ups discus it. also clear salary number mind. plenty way come number research site like levels.fyi glassdoor h1bdata maybe even reach others industry. clear number bump 15 20 . principle 2 keep emotion anger friend. nice friend. gentle friend. loyal friend always tell u betrayed ourselves. julia cameron artist way anger good. best interest angry negotiating. instead want firm solution oriented. mean fighting bos company team figuring best work. example give number come back one unhappy instead getting angry simply respond work me. curious arrived number. walk keep emotion focus promotion benefit first you. want hear. principle 3 timing matter performance review coming 3 month wait 2.5 month bring desire raise. start early. bos need time. two tip 1 try bringing successfully completed great project. recency bias real. 2 purely trying maximize money way get competing

opinionated corporate america. one biggest pet peeve someone manages people responsible evaluating hiring retaining people. tl dr two reason company spend money hiring retaining people 1. cost effective put value productivity knowledge performance. 2. hr department self serving generally ignore value productivity knowledge performance order highlight cost saving generated strategies. longer

etc. know enough calculate thing directly calculatable come thing harder quantify... going try. easy quantify decreasing budget raise 1m increase attrition 20 people year cost 30k fill one role saved

management cycle job got raise seems shitty compared work put think underpaid start applying jobs. see happens. maybe find paid market value one pay more. fine work assured company least paying worth. maybe find company willing pay bit money case use leverage higher salary better working conditions. mind need explicitly say better else . say better leave. maybe maybe someone willing pay 20 30 40

make noise get raise. probably cannot solve entire problem people le likely leave get treated le urgent target. completely agree post recommendations. ask assume happy. case got 16 simply asking
