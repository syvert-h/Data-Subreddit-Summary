Start here.,milwted,1675038303.0,Career Advice,459,0.99,"Starting a career in data analytics can open up many exciting opportunities in a variety of industries. With the increasing demand for data-driven decision-making, there is a growing need for professionals who can collect, analyze, and interpret large sets of data. In this post, I will discuss the skills and experience you'll need to start a career in data analytics, as well as tips on learning, certifications, and how to stand out to potential employers.

Starting out, if you have questions beyond what you see in this post, I suggest doing a search in this sub. Questions on how to break into the industry get asked multiple times every day, and chances are the answer you seek will have already come up. Part of being an analyst is searching out the answers you or someone else is seeking.

I will update this post as time goes by and I think of more things to add, or feedback is provided to me.

**Commonly Asked Questions –**

Q) Do I need a degree?

A) Its helpful. Many job postings for DA ask for a bachelor’s degree.

&#x200B;

Q) Will the Google Data Analyst certificate from Coursera be enough to get me a DA job?

A) No. Not even close. The course teaches you some of the basic technical concepts of the industry and that’s about it. My feeling on the course is this – If you took the entire thing from start to finish and it didn’t scare you away, you may have a chance at this.

More on this certification -- It is marketed really well as being a potential game changer.  This cert gets asked about 10x more than any other.  Again, it is not a magical key to the industry.  It lets you peek in the door to see what you are getting yourself into.

&#x200B;

Q) How do I transition from X field I am in today to become a Data Analyst?

A) See the list below for the tips on how to do it.

&#x200B;

Q) I already have a degree in X, will that help me?

A) Depends on the position, the recruiter, and the company.  Most job postings show that they are looking for a degree in a related field -- Business, Statistics, etc.  The more relevant, the better your chances are that it will help.  Remember, a degree is just one part of an entire package you should have to help you transition into the field.

&#x200B;

Q) What do I need to learn?

A) Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI or Tableau is a good place to start. I would also learn them in that order. From those, you can start branching out to learn more, such as SSRS, Azure, SAS, Looker, Alteryx, etc.

&#x200B;

Q) Do certifications matter?

A) Depends on the person doing the hiring. To some recruiters, it means you have at the minimum a basic knowledge set on the topic. To others, they may see them as useless throwaways that anyone spending 30 minutes on the Internet could get.

&#x200B;

Q) Can I get a job right away?

A) Depends on your experience level.  If you are trying to break in from another career, its going to be difficult and like any job hunt, you will probably be passed up for those that are experience already.  Its going to come down to your knowledge of the field and how well you market yourself.  See #11 below.

&#x200B;

Q) Is having a degree in X enough to get me a DA role?

A) Probably not.  Again, depends on the company and the hiring manager.  You are going to improve your chances by adding a great resume and experience to your degree.

\---------------------------------------------------

**Roadmap to break in to analytics:**

1. Build a Strong Foundation in Data Analysis and Visualization: The first step in starting a career in data analytics is to familiarize yourself with the basics of data analysis and visualization. This includes learning SQL for data manipulation and retrieval, Excel for data analysis and visualization, and data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau. There are many online resources, tutorials, and courses that can help you to learn these skills. Look at Udemy, YouTube, DataCamp to start out with.
2. Get Hands-on Experience: The best way to gain experience in data analytics is to work on data analysis projects. You can do this through internships, volunteer work, or personal projects. This will help you to build a portfolio of work that you can showcase to potential employers. If you can find out how to become more involved with this type of work in your current career, do it.
3. Network with people in the field: Attend data analytics meetups, conferences, and other events to meet people in the field and learn about the latest trends and technologies. LinkedIn and Meetup are excellent places to start. Have a strong LinkedIn page, and build a network of people.
4. Education: Consider pursuing a degree or certification in data analytics or a related field, such as statistics or computer science. This can help to give you a deeper understanding of the field and make you a more attractive candidate to potential employers. There is a debate on whether certifications make any difference. The thing to remember is that they wont negatively impact a resume by putting them on.
5. Learn Machine Learning: Machine learning is becoming an essential skill for data analysts, it helps to extract insights and make predictions from complex data sets, so consider learning the basics of machine learning. Expect to see this become a larger part of the industry over the next few years.
6. Build a Portfolio: Creating a portfolio of your work is a great way to showcase your skills and experience to potential employers. Your portfolio should include examples of data analysis projects you've worked on, as well as any relevant certifications or awards you've earned. Include projects working with SQL, Excel, Python, and a visualization tool such as Power BI or Tableau. There are many YouTube videos out there to help get you started. Hot tip – Once you have created the same projects every other aspiring DA has done, search for new data sets, create new portfolio projects, and get rid of the same COVID, AdventureWorks projects for your own.
7. Create a Resume: Tailor your resume to highlight your skills and experience that are relevant to a data analytics role. Be sure to use numbers to quantify your accomplishments, such as how much time or cost was saved or what percentage of errors were identified and corrected. Emphasize your transferable skills such as problem solving, attention to detail, and communication skills in your resume and cover letter, along with your experience with data analysis and visualization tools. If you struggle at this, hire someone to do it for you. You can find may resume writers on Upwork.
8. Practice: The more you practice, the better you will become. Try to practice as much as possible, and don't be afraid to experiment with different tools and techniques. Practice every day. Don’t forget the skills that you learn.
9. Have the right attitude: Self-doubt, questioning if you are doing the right thing, being unsure, and thinking about staying where you are at will not get you to the goal. Having a positive attitude that you WILL do this is the only way to get there.
10. Applying: LinkedIn is probably the best place to start. Indeed, Monster, and Dice are also good websites to try. Be prepared to not hear back from the majority of companies you apply at. Don’t search for “Data Analyst”. You will limit your results too much. Search for the skills that you have, “SQL Power BI” will return many more results. It just depends on what the company calls the position. Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Visualization Specialist, Business Intelligence Manager could all be the same thing.  How you sell yourself is going to make all of the difference in the world here.
11. Patience: This is not an overnight change. Its going to take weeks or months at a minimum to get into DA.

Be prepared for an application process like this

100 – Jobs applied to

65 – Ghosted

25 – Rejected

10 – Initial contact with after rejects & ghosting

6 – Ghosted after initial contact

3 – 2nd interview or technical quiz

3 – Low ball offer

1 – Maybe you found something decent after all of that

I made it to the final interview for both jobs, but didn’t get an offer.  But since I updated my LinkedIn, a recruiter reached out to me. For context, I was an accountant and I have a degree in accounting. He was looking for someone with strong accounting knowledge and SQL/Python skills. I was the perfect fit. I nailed the interview process and signed my offer yesterday!

dataanalysis,q37irg,Google Data Analysis Course review,Free_Dimension1459,1633607993.0,,298,1.0,"Hi all,

I'm into week 4 of the 7th course, having just a little bit or R and the Capstone to go through. I also just got offered a job as a data analyst and *really* impressed my interviewers which helped with the salary negotiations. For a little bit on my background, I've a decade of experience in project management and wanted to get into data analytics because I'm feeling miserable as a PM, not able to find a job in that field, and my company has no growth opportunities (literally a staff of 10 and 1 new sale in 2 years - most our revenue is recurring so it's sustainable but definitely not getting promoted there until someone retires in 10 years).

I plan to update this review twice. Once after completing the Capstone, and 6 months into my new job. I will break it down into 3 categories, Foundations (Course 1 and 2 and a dash throughout the course), Tools covered (primarily courses 3 through 7), Soft Skills taught, and grade each aspect of the overall course in 4 ways, with minimum scores of 1 and maximums of 5. 

Qualitative review - what was good, bad, in text. Just a paragraph. Skip it if you don't like to read.

Interview prep - the tldr on how useful this type of content was in interviews. Does the knowledge spark join in your future manager.

Job prep - how useful I think this type of content will be on the job. The tldr is market relevancy.

Breadth - how much you have to play with these tools *OUTSIDE* of what the course offers to make use of them. The higher the score, the less I would worry about checking out other places to learn this stuff.

&#x200B;

**Overall comments on the interview process**

I went through a screen, and two interviews at a large institution. The first interview involved a data analyst and the hiring manager. The second interview brought those same two people back and introduced the department VP and a director of the department I am being hired into.

&#x200B;

**Foundations of data analytics**

This part of the courses was phenomenal for getting the job. Talking about the PROCESS of data analytics at a high level, how communication plays a role (this piece is really emphasized in Course 6, again foundations are sprinkled throughout the entire 7 courses), and where engaging stakeholders matters really impressed the decision-makers in my interview. I was interviewed by a VP, 2 director level people (including the hiring manager), and 1 data analyst. The analyst was less impressed, but mastering the process talk and how to engage your stakeholders really impressed the decision-makers in the room. The hiring manager smiled every time I emphasized first understanding the problem, the stakeholders, and the data - she also smiled when I emphasized data cleaning as really important.

* Interview Prep - 5/5. Definitely the most important piece for interviews, as long as you're not being asked to write code or pseudo code. Mastering the foundations impresses the decision-makers.
* Job prep - 3/5. Talking alone won't help you work with data. It's helpful to know who to talk to and how to talk, but it does not make you an analyst. Update Apr. '22 - I'd upgrade this to a 4/5. Getting acquainted with the data and systems at a new company takes time - knowing good and best practices while you do this lets you enhance your learning as you go.
* Breadth - 5/5. I do not think you *have* to go elsewhere for *an introduction* to data analytics concepts. What they cover, in the foundational sense, is *very good.*

**Tools Covered**

Spreadsheets, SQL, Tableau, and R are the main tools covered. Listing these on my resume was enough to get a roughly 70% call back across multiple job applications. These tools are *hot* on the market, as best I can tell. That's a much better call back rate than I got for Project Management and other jobs when I last went on the market some 4-5 years ago. The one thing many employers ask about is PowerBI instead of Tableau. I think it's important to tell them on the phone that ""I've learned the skill, it may take a little bit to get used to the tool, but PowerBI and Tableau use the same skill."" Most people seem to agree.

Please note. There are some checklists that they share through the course and these I have used in my current job as a project manager. These tools I would rate as excellent, because a checklist helps you focus your brain cells on the stuff that matters; as long as you establish and follow a good checklist you won't screw up the small stuff.

* Interview Prep - 4/5. Tools will come up during your interviews for data analysis. 100%. Depending on the employer you may or may not have to *show* what you know. Building a Portfolio is super helpful - the course suggests that and my understanding is the Capstone helps you build that (will update when I first update my review in 8 weeks or so).
* Job Prep - 3/5. This grade is **not** a reflection on the course. The market is wildly different depending on company size, and you may have to learn and pull data from a unique ecosystem of software and a unique sets of schema at varying levels of documentation depending on the company. No coursework can truly prepare you for the worst you will see out there. The real world can be very messy, and a lot of what is taught in the course is close to ideal. Update Apr. '22 - this remains spot on; I use Tableau, BIRT, and Oracle Answers as my 3 primary tools (but also Amazon Redshift, Excel, and a couple other tools) in my job. No one course can teach you all you need to be an analyst at any company.
* Breadth - 3/5. You will want to dive into Kaggle, Tableau Public, etc. to see what other people do and build your skills a little bit more than what the course offers. They show you how to build your skills and use the help documentation, which is *really important* but it does not get you to ""I am a master of"" Tableau, R, spreadsheets, or SQL by any stretch. Update Apr. '22 - See update on ""Job Prep"" above - you may end up using more or fewer tools than you'd think and it's all up to your employer.

**Soft** **Skills taught**

The soft skills really matter! Pay attention. They really seem to try to do right by the people taking the course and cover presentation skills, interview skills, strategies for dealing with some amount of ambiguity, having an ally in the room during presentations, etc. This is stuff I wish I had known early in my career, outside of data analytics. If you took this course and ended up working in something completely unrelated to data analytics, you would still take home a lot of skills that are valuable in the workplace.

* Interview Prep - 4/5. While some of the soft skills are not necessarily going to come up during a data analyst interview, a lot of soft strategies like ""repeat the question, make sure you understand and can gather your thoughts, then answer the question"" translate VERY WELL to an interview setting. As you prepare to interview, think about these nuggets of insight they sprinkle across all the courses and really record yourself practicing a presentation like the course suggests. It's super helpful to get rid of those pesky verbal crutches like ""um"" that we all use.
* Job Prep 5/5 - Some of these soft skills I have integrated into my current job as a Project Manager to great success. Some of these things I already learned from experience. I wish I had known all of it at the start of my career.
* Breadth 4/5 - I can only speak to my own experience and these soft skills help you navigate your work environment very effectively. I know there are toxic work environments out there, but luckily I have never been in one. There's unfortunately no substitute for experience here and that's where you'll get the remaining breadth in this area. The more you ask for, convey, and present information, the better you will get at doing this. Update Apr. '22 - I'd upgrade this to a 5/5. My presentation game has shot up through the roof and a part of it is doing some of the common sense suggestions from this course (practicing and validating your presentations, but more importantly ""how"" to practice and validate your presentations).

**Overall course review**

Is your goal to get a job? A+. Master the foundations and practice those soft skills. If your goal is to keep that job once you get it, make sure to dig into the specific things your company does and uses, and do some targeted self-learning. Literally, if it was a logistics company, practice with the map features in Tableau, look for those visualizations in Tableau Public, and learn to use libraries like ggmap and usmap (if in the USA) in R. 

Is your goal to become a better analyst or get a raise? B to B+. I think the comments on my ""Breadth"" score for tools cover explain why.

Update Apr. '22 - I am so happy I did A course before jumping on this career path. I am pretty sure ANY course would help get started on this career path like it helped me switch into it. Tableau is highly in demand and you don't need this course to learn it, but the course sprinkles some context as to how you get and validate that data and (for me) it helped me validate that I really do love this type of work. This is what I want to do, and I'm glad I get paid to do it.

* Interview Prep - 4/5 if you have to do a technical interview to 5/5 if you are interviewing with executives. I would say, when you are contacted to schedule an interview, it is OK to ask what type of interview it will be. HR is mostly in the loop of whether it's going to be a behavioral screen or a technical interview. If it's the hiring manager who called you, you're impressing on them how you like to be prepared - ultimately an attractive quality when you are hiring.
* Job Prep 4/5 - Expect variety from workplace to workplace. Just like you may use JIRA in one place and ZenDesk someplace else (these are both ticketing tools to log work requests), the same is true for data analytics tools. The good news is once you know R, you can learn Python. Same with Tableau and its alternatives, the variety of SQL flavors, and with spreadsheet tools. You may also encounter data in other formats like JSON, XML, and such - the good news is there are plugins and libraries to just convert this into a table, which should be familiar to you by the end of the course. The most important piece, in my opinion, is the emphasis on understanding and communicating. Understand the analysis task, talk to your stakeholders, make use of the right professional forums to get questions answered, and work with your colleagues and you should be fine (at least, I hope I will!). Wish me luck the next 6 months as I discover if I am right here.
* Breadth 4/5. I don't think it's possible to cover everything, and not necessarily useful to dive deep into something like the usmap library in R if you will not be working with map data at all (this is something I took time to dive into for my own portfolio, not covered in the course). I learned how to read the R documentation and solve the hurdles I encountered to map the rent to income ratio across the US and I definitely could not have done that 4 months ago. You're taught how to fish, but there's a lot of different kinds of fish out there.

Edit 1. Completed course now, including the capstone. No new notes other than, the less work experience you have the more you should build a portfolio as the capstone suggests. That will put you in more equal footing to a more experienced applicant without a portfolio. Next update will be several months into my new job to re-evaluate the “job prep” ratings I awarded

Edit 2, Jan 17, 2022. 3 months into my new job as a data analyst. I am loving the job and thriving. My blood pressure is way better. I’ve been a better husband at home and my wife and I are expecting. Life is looking up. HYPE.

I stand by my review, except I’d say that the job prep is EXCELLENT on the logical / intellectual side and merely good on the technical side of things. You get to talk and have kick ass whiteboard (or zoom drawing) sessions that have impressed my colleagues. My Tableau skills are still miles behind the most experienced users, but I’ve been able to quickly up my game while contributing on the thinking / prototyping end of things.

Edit 3, Apr 10, 2022. 6 months in and I have two new things to say.

1- language is the biggest skill learned in this course. Googling assistance to solve a problem you're facing is much easier because you know the language better.

2- One data visualization resource NOT covered in the course that I've found supremely helpful is Steve Wexler's blog (if it is linked in the course, sorry Google) https://www.datarevelations.com/resources/ - Wexler talks through simplifying your visualizations in a very digestible, common sense way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/q37irg/google_data_analysis_course_review/
dataanalysis,xx8z4a,Data Analyst First Job,ClassicHaunting6356,1665072365.0,Career Advice,301,0.99,"Well folks, I wanted to say this and just told my family and wife.  I don’t have a lot of friends to celebrate with.  So, I figured I would come on and say that I finally was offered a data analyst position.

I am still cautiously optimistic and still can’t fully believe it.  I got the formal offer and was both relieved/cried.

I’m self taught and don’t have a degree in data analysis, stats, physics or math.  I have a assoc. engineering tech degree I did years ago.  Also, have two other associates. I did it with a combo of mentorship, online courses, and other project guided videos, YouTube, to utilizing my skills to build an online portfolio.  Also, used every skill I could in my current job.  I didn’t do any certs.  Although, that was likely my next step.  I did have a background managing projects, worked closely with engineers, and did do visualization, data collection and data studies years ago.  I also have domain knowledge in the field.

This is not a brag, but I just want to tell others that it really is possible. It is doable, but the level of applications I did and applied to while maintaining my hope...was unforgiving and mentally abusive at one point.  I thought many times, and even told my wife, I wonder if Edison felt this way, like I was Edison trying to invent the light bulb or something.  I got so many rejections, so many interviews that led to only the first call only to get ghosted or rejected.  Others led to 2nd or 3rd and I did skills tests only to pass them then get told they were moving on with someone else.  Even worse was when I didn’t do well, and felt my inferiority.

I am almost embarrassed to admit how many apps I have done.  But it is well into the 400 plus range.  It is brutal and takes a tremendous effect on your psyche.

I still haven’t started the role yet.  However, I wanted to tell everyone sometimes persistence pays off.  My wife cautiously reminded me, but it “worked out” for you.  And “how many try, give up or are still trying.”  Also, the Phrase “insanity is doing something over and over again expecting a different result.”  It is sure what it felt like.

I just want to say, if you didn’t follow a traditional route....College, degree/internship...it is stupid hard.  Others may not think so.  But I rank this as one of the most stressful and challenging things I’ve ever done.  Period.

If anyone wants advice I am willing to provide some.  This community taught me a lot and I want to give back.  I couldn’t even look at it for a while because I just focused on the hustle.  Which I recommend you do the same.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/xx8z4a/data_analyst_first_job/

Since coming here to bolster my CV a few weeks ago, I applied to 25-30 jobs over a 1 week period. I got through to the first stage on 6 applications (failed 2/didn't hear from 2/rejected 1), and offered 1 full time position.

I came from a tech support role and had some professional experience using Excel, but nothing advanced. The company I heard back from were looking to fill 2 positions, one trainee, and the other more senior. Managed to land the more senior position. SQL and Python are not needed for the job, but they intend on using them in the future.

So again, thank you for this sub, thanks for the help, and to anyone whose hoping to land a data analyst job without a degree, it is absolutely possible. May not be a blue chip company offering bags of cash, but it's definitely possible.

dataanalysis,viupg3,I Finished the Google Data Analytics Program - My Thoughts,New_Pizza_Rich,1655983702.0,,243,1.0,"I have many years of data and analyst background. Here's an overall breakdown:

There are 8 sections but really 7 plus a capstone project (optional, I didn't do it) which includes interviewing and resume tips/suggestions. The main tools/skills covered are analytical thinking, problem-solving, Excel, SQL, Tableau, and R. The only thing new to me was R. The rest I have been using for a while now. 

This program provides an excellent foundation for starters. It teaches the basics and how to approach a project or data handling. The interviews with Google Employees provide a nice insight for individuals who are new to the field. 

The program states it takes about 6 months but it's really up to the individual's experience and knowledge. I think it took about 2 months and I was very slow about it too. I watched all the videos at 2x speed. I spent a lot of time on R which was new to me. I completed the certification for resume appeal and to see what Google is teaching. I went through my public county library which offered Coursera online for free. After this, I am planning to take another Coursera course on R and Python. 

Would the certification alone get you a job if you have 0 experience? I personally don't think so. But a nice portfolio or the capstone will definitely help. So if you don't have experience, don't skip out on the capstone. 

Just want to share my experience since there are frequent questions about the Google Data Analytics Program.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/viupg3/i_finished_the_google_data_analytics_program_my/

dataanalysis,vl4bus,My suggestion for building a portfolio when you have no work experience,oscarb1233,1656248735.0,Career Advice,220,1.0,"If you're applying for a first Data Analyst role and have no work experience at all, then it’s very likely you’ll need to create a portfolio to develop and demonstrate your analytical skills. It’s not impossible to land a job without one, but having a good one will improve your chances significantly (in my experience).

It can be tough to know where to start or what projects to develop. You don’t want to waste your time developing something that isn’t effective at landing you a job, either because the portfolio doesn’t demonstrate relevant skills or the projects are very far off base what your potential employers are looking for.

When you’re developing your portfolio, it should ideally do a few things:

* It must help you actually practise data analysis. These take time and practice to develop. The more projects you can do, the better you’ll get and if you are in the fortunate position to be able to develop lots of projects, then you can afford to start revising your early attempts and make them even better.
* It’ll help you feel more confident when you are interviewing, especially if your projects touch on aspects of the roles you’re applying for.
* You develop the skills most relevant to your future first role.

An additional benefit is that you will become more data literate as your practice, so even if you end up taking an interim role while continuing your job hunt, you might find that you can leverage that interim role to start incorporating data analysis into it - further accelerating your skill development and perhaps making it easier to switch to an above-entry level role.

With this mindset in place, how can you optimise your time spent developing these skills?

1. **Pick your target industry**

My suggestion is to first pick an industry in one of two ways:

* One where you already have an area of interest or are really passionate about. Maybe you’ve always liked Sports Analytics, Healthcare, Marketing or something else, or;
* Pick one where most of the jobs seem to be and you feel at least neutral towards it. When you are job searching, take notes of which industry keeps coming up as hiring data analysts. In the case of the Netherlands, these seem to be Banking, Utilities and Ecommerce at the moment. All of these are always hiring for all levels. I say you should at least feel neutral towards it, because I will always advise against going for jobs in industries you just don’t like. I think it could stunt your future growth if you aren’t keen on the work.

By the way, you aren't forever bound to which one you pick. You are free to choose another, but you’ll start off with the cards stacked in your favour and hopefully the first try works out.

**2. Analyse the job ads**

Now that you have a target industry in mind, continue looking at the job ads (both active and expired) and start capturing notes on them. Pen and paper is fine but a google doc that you can later refer to is probably more convenient. Make one main list for this and just keep adding to it every time you look at an ad:

* What **skills** are they looking for? Every time they mention SQL, Power BI etc add a checkmark next to it.
* What **tasks** are they describing? Pick out the key descriptions (usually listed as bullet points of activities) and start figuring out what the pattern is across them. Try group them into themes or clusters.  Even if you don’t know what these are, write them down anyway. You might later learn enough that helps you understand what these tasks are.
* How do they describe their company and the **problems** they’re trying to solve?

**3. Outline your possible projects that optimise for this industry’s profile**

With your **list of skills** in hand, you should be able to see what tools and software to steer towards. 90% of the job ads mention PowerBI and not Tableau, then it makes sense to use PowerBI instead of Tableau.

With the **tasks** grouped and counted, you can focus on projects that demonstrate those that seem to come up the most. If they mention a lot of particular analytical methods, or data cleaning, or geospatial work, or web scraping - then work those into your portfolio wherever possible.

With the **problems or goals they’ve described**, these can be great sources of what business questions to centre your analyses around. Do they talk a lot about customer acquisition? Then do some more research around the problems of customer acquisition and let that form the basis of your analyses.

**4. Search for your datasets**

Now that you’ve got a good idea of the industry and their problems, search for datasets (or create them if possible) that get you close to being able to develop projects that attempt to answer them. If you can’t find exactly what you're looking for (which is very likely), then expand the scope of datasets you can find or alter the possible questions to be able to use what you have found.

This should help you be much more motivated to build a portfolio if it feels like you’re building towards skills you’ll use on Day 1 of the job. Let me know how it goes!

dataanalysis,xaxvwd,Career Shift / Google Cert Success Story!,expressanddiscard,1662838317.0,,186,0.99,"Hello all! I'm excited to share that I've accepted an offer for my very first data analyst job! Here's how it happened...

I spent ten-plus years in the hospitality industry, mostly as a bartender, working at nearly every level from barback to beverage director in both major and smaller markets. The COVID era, along with simply getting older, brought about some serious burnout and an unhealthy lifestyle that I just couldn't maintain. I never saw my family, I was working super long hours, and not getting paid what I was worth.

Back in April I came across the Google Certificate. It immediately spoke to me. I had been working in Excel for years for inventory / costing / tracking profits and so I felt like I had a bit of a leg up. I also had a few close friends who had also transitioned out of the restaurant/bar world into tech and coding and bounced the idea with them and got a lot of encouragement. 

I picked up SQL and R pretty easily as I have an academic background and they basically feel a little like logic puzzles. I turned it into a game! Certificate coursework and query practice became a daily thing and I spent hours at local coffee shops with some lofi beats in the headphones and caffeine in the brain (Spotify has some great playlists designed for coding).

Besides the capstone project, I took a few other courses on Coursera on visualization, Python, and a more intensive SQL course, and all of that helped tremendously. I scoured through open-source dataset websites and found things that piqued my interest and created mini projects for myself.

I started applying and of course got many many many rejections but after a series of interviews with about 4 different companies I got one that seemed to be getting some traction. Although I was mostly interested in remote work, this one was on-site in my city. At first, this disinterested me, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized having a team with me would really help me nourish my newfound skills. Plus, I'm used to working on-site with people I can bounce ideas off of and be challenged by.

After 3 interviews I got an offer! It's a manufacturing company working mostly with Excel and SQL. It's $55k a year, full benefits, PTO, everything. They even have a gym in the office! I'm so excited to get started. I'm also terrified and having all the imposter syndrome feelings that many others I've seen on here deal with. I hope to update soon with some good stories!

One of the best pieces of advice I got early on was to start applying BEFORE you think you're ready. Just start getting a lot of rejections. You'll get used to them. And in the meantime, keep practicing and finding little projects to sink your teeth into. Utilize LinkedIn and the Skills Assessments they have. Put together a really solid cover letter that gives a narrative to your resume, and tweak it slightly for each company you send it to. Emphasize soft skills and do plenty of interview prep. 

Also, don't forget about Excel. It's tempting to go deep into programming languages and everything but a lot of companies still really love Excel. For good reason, too -- it's incredibly powerful and can do so much more than you may think it can. It's the foundation for data-driven business management. The Google Cert doesn't really go into Macros/VBA but take a look into that and you'll see what I mean.

Anyway, thank you for coming to my TED Talk! Wish me luck as I wish you yours!

Dear everyone,

I am pleased to inform you all that I have recently been accepted for a data analyst role. I recently turned 50, and I would like to encourage everyone to keep their hopes high in pursuing any career they desire.

To start my journey, I will be taking the Google Data Analytics course, while continuing with the Statistics and Excel courses that I have already begun on Coursera. I am grateful for all the support that I have received from this amazing community and would appreciate any further advice or feedback that you may have for me.

If you would like to follow my progress, you can find me on #onehoursmarter. 

Unfortunately, I am not able to share any details about my new role due to a signed NDA.

Thank you all again for your support.

I now make 100k in the midwest and work as a data engineer/analyst.

I am available to answer any questions.

TLDR at bottom.

&#x200B;

**My Background:**

Midwest.

Graduated in 2016 with bachelors in Sociology.

I learned absolutely no technical skills in college and had almost no idea of what data analytics was or what I wanted to do. I knew no sql, python, or even excel for the most part.

&#x200B;

# First Job

*Title = Product data specialist. $10/hour*

**How I got my first job**

(no skills test)

All I did was search ""data"" on Linked In, hit ""easy apply"" and took the first job that called me. The interview was beyond simple and I was told I was hired because the interviewer ""liked me"". The point here is, SMILE, be engaging, be human, in addition to everything else.

It was $10 an hour doing basically data entry. It didn't even require excel in my initial role. I took pdfs of product sheets and typed the information into the company backend.

**How I grew within the company**

I discovered pretty quickly that when I'm getting paid I have a strong desire to fix all the stupid things and inefficiencies and inconsistencies around me. That's mostly what I did. Without being asked, I created documentation of our processes. I created formalized excel templates. Since I'm lazy, I eventually learned a little VBA and sped up some manual copy/pasting type stuff in excel. It was a small company and they quickly had me filling in work in two other departments, one of which was completely unrelated. I was told it was because I was a ""fast learner"".

**Key Takeaways:**

Even a low paying, simple job at a small company can have incredible opportunity if you LOOK for it and just do things without being asked. Superiors notice quickly because apparently most people don't take initiative to improve things or learn without being told.

**Skills Update**

I learned excel and a little bit of VBA on the job but also spent time learning excel outside of the job - really digging into understanding formulas more.

&#x200B;

# Second Job

*Title = Reporting analyst, promoted to sr. data analyst. 42k/47k salary + 5-7k annual weekend work.*

**How I got my second job**

(no skills test)

Now I was a little smarter and expanded by search criteria to include ""analyst"". I found a company I liked and spent two hours on a very tailored cover letter. I don't know how much that improved my chances but I feel it helped. I spent probably 4 hours researching the company and preparing for the interview. I still didn't have much technical skill, but the job I was applying for only required excel and sql, I already had excel. I sold myself mostly on my ability to learn quickly and improve things quickly. I had a lot of energy and brought a friendly demeanor. These always help but I feel especially when you don't have much else to lean on.

**How I grew within the company**

At this job I discovered I have a high level of curiosity. I was given full read access to the entire companies databases (small company). I began doing my own analysis on questions I had like ""is it possible to predict which of our ads will perform better before we launch them?"" Through this, I taught myself python, r, machine learning basics and took it upon myself to give a presentation of the results. Most of this was done on my own time outside of work. But this got me immediately promoted.

Additionally, I used VBA to improve our excel work. I learned python and api usage to speed up our reporting. I took it upon myself to roll some python automation out to another team. All told, I had helped save thousands of hours of work on a yearly basis. It was a startup, no one was worried about being replaced because we were actually doing real work and there was always more work to do. I took it upon myself to teach an analysis class in R to about 15 coworkers, after having taught it to myself. I learned a bit of javascript to create google sheets automation, which we used heavily.

I took the machine learning and deep learning specializations on coursera.

And in my own time I began taking on complex python projects (extracting midi from an acoustic piano using raspberry pies, a script that would create templatized youtube videos, etc).

The bottom line is I worked my ass off and probably worked 40 hours a week at the job + 20-30 hours a week outside of work learning and teaching myself. The way I saw it, this was an investment in my future. The faster I upped my skills the faster I could make more money. And I wouldn't have to work like that forever, only until I got to where I wanted to go.

Learning coding was not easy for me, especially with no real-life teacher. I often thought I wasn't capable of it and I wasn't smart like ""those other people"". I do feel I'm slower to pick things up than other people, but I overcame this mostly because there were so many questions I wanted to answer and systems I wanted to automate that I forced myself to learn what I needed to learn to do what I wanted to do.

**Key Takeaways**

Don't be afraid to spend time learning outside of work and outside of school. You'll outpace almost everyone if you do. Take initiative within your company to improve things without being asked. Also, be friendly. And if you feel you aren't smart enough, hey, I felt like I was a dummy for a long time. I didn't do well in school. But I eventually made it. If you keep working hard (in my case, really hard) and efficiently, it's almost impossible not to improve.

**Skills Update**

Python, R, Sql, excel, vba, some javascript, good basic understanding of machine learning.

&#x200B;

# Third Job

*Title = Business Analyst. 67k*

**How I got my third job**

(no skills test)

This one was a mess. I wanted to get into data science but I found out I didn't have enough hard skills in that area. I wanted to continue growing in a more challenging role so I took an analyst role at a mega corporation, but the company I worked for had almost no work for me to do. It was horribly run and i hated every second of it. Eventually I left. I quit with absolutely no job prospects lined up and without even being actively interviewing anywhere. I had a couple months money saved up.

**Key Takeaways**

Don't stick with a job you hate.

**Skills Update**

No change.

&#x200B;

# Fourth (current) Job

*Title = Data Scientist (but do the work of an engineer/analyst) 72k as contractor, then 92k when promoted to full time with 10k annual bonus.*

**How I got my fourth job**

(skills test was writing 1 query and creating a pandas dataframe)

The biggest things that helped me here were: 1) I had done so many personal projects and taken such initiative on my own and they really liked that (some companies really don't seem to care about that though). 2) When they asked me a question I didn't fully understand, I asked for clarification before answering it. I learned later this was a huge deal in their minds and also learned a lot of people don't do this. 3) I also asked a lot of questions. That's important as well, especially in a higher level role where they need to know you're able to use your own brain and figure things out. That's very correlated to being able to ask high quality questions.

**How I grew within the company**

I have stood out in this position the same as previous positions: I improve poor quality systems where I can. Let the team know generally about design weaknesses that I see. Create documentation where the is none. Do things without being asked. Question why things are done the way they are. Put in 110% effort and make sure everything I put out is high quality. I find that even at a higher level, a lot of people still don't put in as much effort into their work as I would expect. Put in a lot of effort, continue learning and you will stand out.

&#x200B;

# TDLR

* No amount of experience is too small to get started in the field. Wherever you're at now, start learning and progressing.
* You don't HAVE to go back to school to start in the field. Start learning on your own. You don't even need to pay for classes online or do a bootcamp. I never did. But I worked hard.
* Opportunities for growth will probably not be handed to you. Find them. Create them. And implement them on your own. Don't wait for permission (if it's something simple, like a team-process enhancement)
* Do high quality work. Every time. Never be lazy in your quality of work.
* Question why things are done the way they are, particularly if you have better suggestions or see an obvious flaw. I haven't personally worked for companies that aren't receptive toward improvements.
* Work your ass off by:
   * Learning on your free time and doing things at work that further your skills and up your quality of work. This is an investment in yourself.
   * Don't kill yourself in a job that demands a lot from you but isn't improving your skillset or paying you like crazy.
* Don't waste time learning things that won't be useful to you. There are too many distractions. Stay focused. Do only what brings you the most value. I only ever focused on learning tools that would help me where I was at, not where I wanted to go in my ""next job"".
* You may increase your salary in a shorter timescale by job/company hopping than by staying in one job.
* If you feel like you're too dumb to do this work, don't worry too much. I felt incredibly dumb for a long time, but I pushed forward in spite of it.
* Technical skill doesn't make up for other deficiencies. I have seen highly technical people who lacked business sense, lacked curiosity, lacked social skills, lacked interview skills, lacked self-awareness - to their detriment. Inspect your own weaknesses and improve. Always improve.
* Excel/sql/python/pandas are definitely at the top of the list for being useful in this field. Along with tableau/powerBI. Pandas doesn't have much value in getting you a job because somehow a lot of companies aren't terribly aware of it, but has been invaluable for making my life easier within my roles.

dataanalysis,u5fhur,My observations from the CVs of people who are making a switch to Data Analysis,Acceptable_Bug4435,1650170330.0,Career Advice,155,0.99,"Recently, i had the opportunity to review applications to an open Data Analyst position at my work place and a lot of applicants were from diverse backgrounds who are looking to break into Data Analysis. As i often read in this subreddit about frustrations/ questions around how to successfully break into Data analyst roles, I would like to share my observations in the hope that it helps you. ( I'll update the list as the interview process continues)
1. The CV is too amorphous - While i understand that when you don't have relevant work experience in the same field, you can't write too much in terms of experience, a very vague profile highlighting only your SQL capabilities doesn't make your profile to stand out. 
2. Business/ Domain knowledge is sexy - What I mean by this is, show off your knowledge about the business topic for which you are applying (medical field / finance / marketing). This is extremely appealing to me as a recruiter and I'm willing to overlook your lack of work experience writing SQLs and python scripts to carry out cool analysis and build visualisation. This is because, people who do have a degree in data analysis, often do not learn about businesses. Please recognise that this is where you have the advantage! If you are someone who's from a totally different space such as teaching mathematics, I'm so excited about what you bring to the team with your knowledge of statistics and all the qualitative/quantitative analysis that you can guide the team with. Similarly, if you're from the field of arts degree, I'd be very interested to see how you can contribute with your perspective about website layout (A/B testing for example) , online consumer behaviour to name a few.

Little back story...

I recently graduated in May (Finance and Information Systems), and was working for this company in a year long graduate rotation program. Through the program I was working through different departments such as :

1. FP&A

2. Data Analysis

3. FP&A again (someone going on maternity leave)

4. Accounting.

After my first rotation with FP&A, I went to my boss and said basically that I wanted to go to another department for my 3rd rotation because I didn't think FP&A was for me. Little did I know that because of this, they said they are using my headcount to hire someone to fill that role for the person going on maternity leave. Basically it felt like they wanted to use me as a cheap option and that they were planning on me doing FP&A all along for them in the long term, when I originally did a rotation to figure out what I want to do professionally. Along with this, my experience with the rotation has been awful through 5 months... most of the time I've had nothing to do, and have been trying to teach myself Data Analyst skills while taking courses to keep myself busy.

They said I am not continuing my rotation, and that I have to find a full-time job with them immediately or leave the company. It never sat right with me that they did this, so I wanted to leave and prove them wrong. I had until they hired someone to make a decision, and I got the job before they did thank god.

Data Analysis was always something for me that sounded interesting, but I knew it was hard to get an entry level role. After a couple months of applying, practicing online, and interview prepping, I FINALLY got a role after having two online interviews, and one in-person.

I can't wait to give my former company my notice on Monday, and I couldn't be more excited to come into this field.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/zauu9a/finally_got_an_entrylevel_data_analyst_job/

dataanalysis,10q93tk,DataAnalyst.com - I launched a niche job board with hand curated data analyst jobs. Here's the summary of how it's going after the first month,kirilale,1675195931.0,Employment Opportunity,109,0.97,"Hi all, 

on Dec 19th I launched [DataAnalyst.com!](https://DataAnalyst.com) - this is the first update (hopefully many more to come).

Want to make sure I document the journey, and keep myself honest, so each month I will be making a post about the statistics, progress, some thoughts and what are the next steps I want to be focusing on.


While the main purpose for the post is to bring everyone along on the journey, I do think that members of r/DataAnalysis might benefit from the site, especially those looking for a new job. 

I'd also love to engage with people on the sub who'd like to share their data analyst career journey. 

If it's not something that belong here, have absolutely no issues to take the post down and / or keep the updates to a different subreddit.

**Early stages vision** is to become the #1 job board for data analysts - hand-picking interesting data analyst job opportunities across industries.


Where I would like to see this going - my **long term vision**, is building a community of aspiring and professional data enthusiasts. A place for those who love data to collaborate, share, learn and develop their careers.


So, let's dive right in.


######**Statistics for January, 2023**

Number of jobs posted: 269 (United States: 208, United Kingdom: 45, Europe: 16)

Paid job posts: 0 (although currently, some jobs were featured free of charge as they coming from my ex-Google network)

Users: 795

Total ""Apply Now"" clicks: 634 (only data available for the last 3 weeks)

Avg. session duration: 3min 52sec

Pageviews: 4100

Avg. time on page:  1m 35sec

Returning visitors: 17.7%

Total Google Impressions: 410 


#General observations: 

- It's hard to find jobs with salaries - atrocious in Europe, US is better due to salary transparency laws in certain states, but even then we're looking at a range bigger than King Kong's first dump of the day 
- UK is much more ""Recruiter agency"" driven - most of the data analyst jobs are being posted by a 3rd party, rather than directly by companies' own HR.  
- As I'm hand picking jobs from various sources, noticed a lot of jobs which have had 100+ applicants are being reopened - what does that mean? Not enough quality candidates in those 100? Are companies just hoarding CVs?

###Thoughts: 
Overall I'm pretty happy about the progress so far, probably actually exceeding my expectations. Even though my initial announcement (19th Dec) mainly attracted my friends / colleagues, the site is getting some traffic through direct type-ins, Twitter and LinkedIn engagements. 

What is more important for me is that I can see visitors spending time on the site, clicking through job posts, and some are actually coming back to check out what's new. 

Something that's annoying me (and most likely also is annoying visitors to the site) is that currently the site is very much US focused, there's no doubt about that. Multiple factors in play - from agency postings in the UK, job being posted in local language, to absolute lack of salaries available in the EU. This obviously has a trickle down effect - imagine you're looking for a data analyst role in France, confirm your filters and you'll see one job - well, that might be an extra job you haven't applied yet, but if there aren't further quality enough listings being added over the course of the week, you'll extremely likely not to come back.

Could that be solved by posting jobs without a salary - yes, it probably could and it would definitely increase the amount of jobs posted for a certain country, on the other hand, I hate not knowing what the salary range is when applying myself. 

Another option would be only focusing on the US market in the initial stages, but I am really not sure how I feel about that.

The site is still extremely fresh, so will monitor behaviours for the first 3 months and make a decision then. 


#Things in the pipeline:

- Monthly Data Analyst jobs Hiring Insights - which industries are hiring, salary trends - watch out, January edition coming this week!
- The complete data analyst guide (how to become a data analyst, career path, responsibilities and skills...)
- Day of a data analyst (people in the industry sharing their journey)
- Launch the newsletter - honestly this should be much higher on my to do list, but really out of my depth to automate it
- Start reaching out to HR / job posters directly



######**So, there are 3 ways you could get involved:**

1. Looking for a new challenge? Check out the website - I'm adding new jobs daily

2. Looking to hire a data analyst to your team? Shoot me a message on Reddit (or alex@dataanalyst.com) and I'll upgrade your first listing for free!

3. I'm in early stages of creating a ""Day of a Data Analyst"" section - if you're open to do an email based interview about your data analyst career journey (and be one of the first featured), just send me a message and we'll organise something.

If you have any questions, concerns, come across glitches - please just reach out, happy to chat. 

Thank you and see you in a month.

My BS is in business, and I have an MBA as well. 

I see a lot of posts here about which technical skills to learn, and that’s great and extremely important, but I wanted to add on something that I don’t see being discussed very often. In my opinion and experience, when getting jobs in this field, it’s really beneficial to have an understanding of business concepts as well. Employers have generally been pretty willing to overlook some technical skills I needed to gain experience in because they also value my business knowledge. 

Having an understanding of the principles of finance, accounting, marketing, etc has been so advantageous for me, and it can really set a candidate apart from other applicants when searching for a job. When I got my first job in this field, I only had a very rudimentary understanding of SQL and had never used a visualization tool, but my boss told me he was willing to take a chance on me because he valued my business understanding so much. 

Having technical skills is great! But IME, adding on these business concepts can help you convey the value your work can provide to the business, as well as give you much more context for the problems you’re trying to solve. It helps a lot to be able to talk about these things in an interview. (As an example: Even just being able to explain the differences between profit, margin, cost of goods sold, return on assets, break even points, etc has provided much benefit to me.) 

I just think it’s something not discussed very often here when talking about what skills to work on, but it’s an important part of a well-rounded skillset!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/xl3pe2/im_back_again_with_another_tip_for_aspiring/

Background: I have a degree in biology, and during peak pandemic I decided I didn’t want to go to med school. 

Recently I finished a data analysis internship at FANG where I learned basic python and tableau. Post internship, I sharped both of those skills and have been studying SQL.

I recently got a job where I’ll be doing IT Analysis. I’ll be building computers and installing them in health care settings around the country, then analyzing the data we get. We will be using SQL, Hex, Tableau and basic python.

Update: how I got the internship at FANG. I used to work Apple retail, and they have internships just for retail employees (in addition to non retail employees) to allow retail employees experience corporate and for corporate to find new talent.

dataanalysis,wuzl31,Snagged My First Job.,TheDulceMan,1661189006.0,Career Advice,99,0.96,"Hey guys, just snagged my first data analyst job out of college, and I thought I’d share my job hunt process. I’ve sent around 50-70 applications, had 5 phone interviews, 2 of those turning into in person interviews, then finally 1 offer. This will be geared towards the US, as I am in Texas. Here are the steps I took: 

1. Bachelors Degree:
Around 99.9% of all the jobs I applied for needed a degree. I have a Degree in Math, all jobs usually wanted some type of STEM related degree, however any degree could work with a good resume and portfolio. I had no internships or any job related to data in college. I have heard you can break into the field with no degree, however it would be extremely difficult to do so I think. 

2. Tailor Your Resume:
This sub helped me out a lot here. Others have posted resumes that were really good, so I just took ideas from those and made my own. YouTube also has good tips for data resumes so I’d look there as well. Put projects on your resume, with a portfolio link so employers can view it. 

3. Projects:
Common knowledge, but I can’t stress this enough. Every interview has been centered around my projects, I had to do a presentation for the data team for one of the interviews. You can message me for more details, but my project process was: Obtain an open dataset online -> clean in excel -> ask myself questions to solve about the data-> solve them in SQL-> Visualize with tableau. I had 3 projects total. 

4. Applying strategy: 
After finishing your resume, I think this is what is more important. I started out applying on indeed, handshake, and linkedin. I stopped using Indeed half way into my process, because there is way too much competition there. So I focused on linkedin and handshake. I always filtered with jobs posted within the last 3 days to a week,  nothing ever after that. Any “promoted” job listing is something to ignore, too much competition. The big thing I’d emphasize is as much as I’d want an at home job, snagging an entry level remote position without any experience is slim. I’d see a remote position have around 300-800 applications sent in. Again, too much competition. Look for On Site positions. It cuts the competition way down, to maybe 40-70 for smaller companies. All you need is that first data analyst title. So I even though I want a remote position, the title means more than anything, so on site it is. Also apply for anything that wants 1-3 years of experience. You never know what job make take a chance on you, as that was the case for my job. Be careful applying to any of the WITCH companies, you can google to see why those are not recommended. (Although I have heard some good stories working for those companies, as it gets your foot in the door.)

5. Interviews: 
Here thankfully I haven’t had a technical interview, since they were more interested in my projects. I’d struggle in a technical interview for sure, so again, projects are good. I was definitely under the gun for both interviews, but confidence is key. 

So yeah, Just thought I share that. I was definitely nervous about how much of a struggle entry level jobs are to get, but I just kept my head down and just kept applying. I also learned lots of stuff from this sub, so thank y’all as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/wuzl31/snagged_my_first_job/

The instructor i was with told us that she has around 120 students in this month alone. Now do the math for all those poor people who fell for this scam and paid 140 euros, and that's just ONE MONTH. The operation is quite smart I'm not going to lie.

I don’t know where to go from here. I’ve been doing the courses on Kaggle to learn about machine learning, although I do understand they do not cover the theory behind machine learning and more the implementation of it.

dataanalysis,irok5l,"the jump from Excel to Python, SQL, and Tableau is so worth it.",chaeboi,1599958179.0,,72,0.97,"Earlier in my career I took time to learn Excel. VBA functions, pivot tables, VLOOKUP, you name it. I felt like I had a good foundation for data analysis, but I wanted to sink my teeth into Python, SQL, and Tableau. 

I noticed so many job descriptions from big tech companies that wanted analysts who could code and automate things. I started to run through Python courses, SQL tutorials, and analysis projects. I ended up landing a data analyst role at a record label and fell even more in love with data analysis.

When I got to the record label I started building data (ETL) pipelines, creating visualizations in Tableau, and conducting in-depth analysis using the pandas library in Python. 

The jump to Python, SQL, and Tableau truly was worth it, but I also don't want to throw any shade at Excel. I used to want to move away from Excel as quickly as possible, but I realized it provided such a solid foundation for what I'm doing now. 

Kind of similar to the manual and automation dynamic. You have to understand the manual process before you can automate. I feel that you have to understand what Excel does before you can understand using Python, SQL, and Tableau together. 

I want to encourage anyone who's currently using Excel and wanting to make the jump into Python, SQL, and Tableau.

It's worth it.

Keep going, keep studying, and you'll move to a point where you're comfortable using Python, SQL, and Tableau over Excel.

Get as much use out of Excel as possible. Maximize your time with it because it will only help your understanding of other technical tools and software later on.

Hi! I am ar\_t\_e\_m\_is, a senior data scientist and member of this sub :) I did create a new profile for this, but I do have a main I'd be willing to share if someone would like to DM.

I am hoping to offer an opportunity for aspiring and junior data scientists or analytics professionals to see what data science and data analytics is all about, by doing a live-stream of a data science project :). It is very common in industry, especially non-tech, for stakeholders to ask for a ""proof of concept"" quickly. I'm going to build one live :)

On **Thursday July 21** around **830pm EST**, I will be doing a livestream on Twitch with a dataset I have never analyzed, and working on a machine learning solution while live streaming :) I will analyze the dataset, prep it for a modeling problem, and try to build and optimize a model while also unlocking business-driven insights :) And, yes, this does include searching Stack Overflow and debugging along the way! During the stream, I will be talking about my career path, how I got to where I am at, and offering insight into the successes and failures of my career.

If you'd like to learn more about my background, I've included a redacted version of my resume.

Would LOVE to see you there, and will be very responsive with answering all questions about the process, my career, and the data science field in general.

If you have any questions, feel free to post below or DM!

I have been working in data analytics for 15 years. I get a lot of DMs on LinkedIn on what makes a data analyst CV. Also I see the question pop up a lot here.. I've hired about 30 analyst in my career and interviewed a ton. 

Here are the things I think really work

1. ROI - If you can demonstrate how you increased cost savings, saved time, or increased X, it catching HR and reviewers eye. This is due to the eye scanning for $ and % signs.
2. Bullet Points. I know this is basic but if you are in data, you need to be exact and making the complex simple is a great skill. Having a novel like resume is a great way to make someone miss out on your skills.
3. Listing the Software and skills in a separate section. Often times, an organization can't hire a candidate if they are not familiar with a specific tech stack of software. This is due to the time and cost for training is factored in to the decision making.
4. Projects--List the projects that or assignments that you received list this out with how and ROI associated with these. It helps show you know how to use data solve problem.

dataanalysis,10zwafm,Faked interview led to a 80k job and suffered ever since - what should I do?,ladynopinion,1676145235.0,Career Advice,69,0.83,"
I’m a 29 F never had any full time job before. With a all-star career coach’s help (he is my partner), I landed an analyst role in a tech company. My teammates are awesome, they are convinced that I’m a multi-functional talent with strong personality and placed me in a project facing role to deal with complex situations.

The reality is I’m beyond incompetent, suck at writing, communication and analysis. This is my first proper job, I even struggled using Excel. My major in college is landscape design and I’m a half decent drawer and painter.

Over the past year, my partner shadowed me for dealing with all the difficult situations, helped me prepare for each presentation and rewrote most of the important emails. I’ve learned a lot but obviously not enough. Something like financial/ analytical mindset is so hard to train. 

Family wise, I have 3 young kids. Meal prep, housework, taking care of kids while doing my current job just seems impossible.

After landing the job, I got vertigo several times, at least once a week I need Tylenol for headache, had one blackout and gained 15 lbs. I had many panic attacks and constantly wake up around 3 am sweating about next day’s work.
I feel ashamed and completely useless, having trouble looking in the mirror.

I see 3 options:

1-Quit my current job and find another analyst job on my own
2-suck it up and learn
3-switch career to art/ design field

Please share your thoughts.

Edit:
Thank you everyone! I didn’t expect this many responses. Apart from sharing my art work, I’ve never posted anything on any social media before. You guys truly helped me organize my thoughts and see possibilities.

I think what stressed me the most is presenting and meetings. My current role only requires SQL, Excel and a little bit of Tableau. I’ve improved quite a bit using tools and will continue to learn, but still very uncomfortable presenting. 
I gave the wrong signal during interviews, mislead them to think I’m the presenter type. Our team has 9 analysts and I’m the one with most exposure to the rest departments in the company. My manager is very supportive, whenever I need to present, she’ll always try to be there in case I can’t handle some questions. I stuttered and felt nauseated many times.

Here’s what I’m going to do:
1- hire help for housework 
2- my year end review conversation is coming next week. I’m going to ask to switch for a role with less exposure, that’ll reduce pressure on me
3- go to the office more often, so my help is out of reach. When WFH, we set a new rule where he will not touch my keyboard 
4- exercise regularly

I ask questions, but I always seem to be wrong in my approach. Overall, I get generalized tips from peers, but at this point I'm looking for a possible solution in regards to maybe a Course or 2 that can rework my thinking (if that's possible).

dataanalysis,uebav7,Wish me luck!,see_ferns,1651198063.0,Career Advice,66,1.0,"Tomorrow is my second interview ever for a data analyst position. The title is Tax Analyst and I’m about a month into my career transition journey. 

Position says they are more so looking for someone good to work with that is excited to learn. They sound like they’re willing to train!

I’m excited and nervous but feeling good. Wish me luck!

Edit: Interview is in a couple hours and I'll be posting my experience later, just wanted to say thank you all so much for the well wishes. You all are the best!

Edit 2: I got the job!!

 while I feel like I over prepared for the interview, I'm glad I did because it made me feel comfortable going in. However, it seems like they really just wanted someone ambitious and fun/good to work with. They will be training people anyway and don't expect any tax experience. Turns out that the interviewers also had unrelated degrees in art and film so I felt comfortable with my sustainability degree.

They seemed like cool people and the company sounds like they're really growing and up to some cool projects with automation and AI that I'll be able to get into one day when I have a better understanding. So, lots of room for growth which is what I want. Then, ten or so minutes after the interview, the recruiter for the position called me and told me I got an offer!

Considering I started this journey only a month ago, I feel super lucky. I realize I'll be starting at the bottom but idc, I have room to grow and a starting salary that is better than my current salary in a job I've been in for years, and its remote! I feel like I hit the jackpot!

For anyone also starting a career transition, working with the recruiter was absolutely key for me in finding a job. Reach out to them and let them know what you want. Don't be afraid to ask for what you really want, because in the end they'll just find you a job you didn't actually want if you don't make it clear to them. 

Thank you all again so much for the well wishes and I'm sending out all the good vibes and well wishes to those also looking for work. Its definitely a struggle but it'll be worth it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/uebav7/wish_me_luck/

People said it would take 200 hours, but I finished it in one day. I didn't watch most of the videos, I just skipped ahead to the quizzes hoping eventually I would find the ""technical part"" of the course, but there was none. The quizzes were mostly about using common sense and behaving professionally, with a tiny bit of spreadsheet/SQL/R syntax sprinkled in.

I thought it would be something that really would build up core skills for data science, but it has basically zero Maths/Stats theory and doesn't have a single Programming assignment.

I don't see how this qualification is viewed in such a positive light. It lacks any proper assignments for developing actual useful technical skills or a theoretical foundation for Data Science and Machine Learning.

All the other data science Coursera courses I did (Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, Mathematics for Machine Learning specialization by Imperial College London, Applied Data Science in Python by University of Michigan) I felt challenged and was learning practical skills and theory.

Some background and context, I am (35M) currently working a full time job as a basic office admin (mostly data entry using SAP and EXCEL) in a large scale company (over 40000 employees) in Dubai, UAE. I plan to apply for a data analyst position in my company by the end of the year, that department uses SQL, PYTHON and TABLEU/POWERBI. I am married and have a 2 year old kid, so I don't get much free time apart from the very late hour or two in the night when all the day's activities and responsibilities are over.

This is when I do my self learning. Currently focusing on SQL as i am fairly decent in Excel since I use it daily at work and will pickup whatever extra is needed as I go along.

I just picked up two books, SQL FOR DUMMIES and after I finish that I will start the SQL COOK BOOK by ANTHONY MOLINARO.


My plan is to go through these books while practicing on Kaggle.com so I learn and use/practice at the same time since in my current role we don't use any thing apart from Excel for the run of the mill trackers and reports, while entering data in SAP.

I have watched and gone through some videos on YouTube and LinkedIn, just the basics in SQL and I intend to stay away from YouTube as it is very easy to get distracted.

Will this be a good plan to start my learning journey? I am in no hurry and want to take my time so I can get my understadings of the foundations right and build up the knowledge gradually.

If there is anything else I should be doing or if I am missing anything considering my position now, please please please advice.

dataanalysis,zkpf2b,Bachelor's in Biology to Master's in Data Analytics. Accepted $90K Offer + Performance Bonus at an Major Bulge Bracket Investment Bank.,chenj38,1670915454.0,Career Advice,59,0.95,"**TLDR**: Did my BS in Biology, Withdraw from Optometry School, Enroll back to my college's Master in DA, Apply to Summer Internship very early, Apply to Full time Job early on, 7 Interview Invites, 1 Job Offer. Copy  of my resume at the bottom.

# Intro

This is not a brag post and I hope my experience helped someone deciding to transition into a new field and on the fence on doing a Masters or not.

I graduated with my BS in Biology a couple of years ago when the pandemic was in a full swing. I was accepted to an Optometry School and was planning to attend after graduation. Unfortunately, they announced that they were changing the modality to Online and I didn't think it was worth paying $65K a year, for 4 years, just to be saturated with debt to be an Optometrist. After some research, I did decided to enroll back into my Alma Mater in their Masters Program in Data Analytics.

&#x200B;

# Master Program

I am no way a scholar student. I had a 3.2 GPA in Biology and withdrew from Chemistry and Organic Chemistry classes before passing with a B-. I noticed my college had a evening Masters program in DA. Strangely, it stated that you could complete the Pre-Reqs the same time as you complete the Core Master Courses. I had almost no experience in Excel, or any programming at all so I was hesitant to enroll. After talking to the graduate counselor, I decided to enroll into the program which took me 3 semesters to finish.

The program was a little bit weird. It was set up for people who have absolute no experience to people that have experience in the field. Languages use were SQL, R, and Python. You could even take electives and learn to use SAS. There was some classes I took that taught advanced Data Mining methods (Neural Network, Association Rule, Clustering etc.). I was expose to using STATA and some Tableau for at least one of my courses. Honestly, it felt more like a Data Science program versus an Data Analytics program. While I took a Pre-Req and an Advanced course in SQL which I had a solid understanding in, but the Python and R Course was pretty lacking. They taught the course with the understanding that the class was a mixture of language proficiency. They didn't teach the very basics and the homework + exams were just changing variables and numbers around. I could look at the code and explain what the code was doing but if you ask me to write it from scratch, I could not do it.

Overall it was an okay Program. They started the program about 4 years ago and definitely were trying to fix the curriculum around to see what worked and not. 50% of the professors that taught this course had full time jobs on the side. It was nice hearing how the stuff we learned in class and which how they apply it to their day job.

&#x200B;

# Internship

I knew from the very start, if I want to find a full time job, I needed some experience. The most impactful way to get one is getting a Summer Internship. If I learn anything about grad school's rolling admission is to APPLY EARLY, longer you wait, the less spots available and harder to get one.  I only started applying 3-4 weeks after I started the Program. I had a great resume back from applying to Optometry School and all I added was a Project section which was some Homework assignment that I did. Surprisingly I did not have to send that much applications out before receiving invites for interviews. I had a solid list of shadowing and various leadership experience. During my talk with recruiters, they were more interested in my soft skills and experience doing other things versus hard technical skills.

    ~30 Applications Sent
    3 Interview Invites
    2 Offers
    1 Rejection

The Offer I accepted was a Fortune 200 manufacturing company paying **$26 an hour**. I applied on their website and the Intern posting was for a Undergraduate student but I manage to score the Offer as a Master's student. During my time, I learn a lot of things. Such as Agile Method, Different Technology Stacks, Communicating with different Orgs, etc. I did a real life project and presented my finding to the entire Division.

To make it short, I received a great Performance review and met my OKR's but.......

I did not received a Full Time offer at the end of the Internship. Even though I did great and the other interns thought I would get one. They wanted someone to hit the ground running with more of an Statistic Background and the couple of courses in Statistics was not cutting it. I also didn't know back then what was a XGBoost or Random Forest was (now I know now lol). I was thinking they wanted someone as a Data Scientist which I definitely did not qualify for.

&#x200B;

# The Job Hunt and Offer

I was disappointed that I didn't receive a return offer but at least I had something that I could showcase on my resume, *Experience*. I started to apply for full time positions right after the Internship and oh boy that was a challenge. Took me 3 months of applying every week to finally receive a fulltime offer.

I knew the economic slowdown and hiring freezes were not looking into my favor. This was my last semester of the Masters and the constant rejection had me a little depressed. One day, I was looking to see at a one particular Bank on the progress of my application of a job role I applied. I noticed there was a Data Analyst job posting the same day on Workday. Read the job description and I hit some basic qualifications (SQL, Six Sigma, Communication, etc.). I did not know what the hell was MicroStrategy or have coding experience in SAS but I apply anyway because I didn't have anything to lose.

A week later I received a call from HR and went trough 4 rounds of interview. I had great discussions with VP and a Manager. I tried to make the interview very conversational since I would be working with them directly. I think what stood out for me was my interest in the Financial Space. I had a interested in Stocks, Financial Market, and Personal Finance. We even talked about Charlie Munger and his ideologies. They also liked that I had experience taking something technical and reducing it down to some understandable from a nontechnical viewpoint. Also my experience talking with stakeholders was a big plus. My technical interview was a little joke compared to a Data Science Case interview I did with a Three Letter Consulting company that I absolutely bombed. They asked me What is a Where Clause, Explain a Subquery, What is a Difference between Inner/Right/Left Join and a Example. I would use mostly SQL which I was good at and they actually have learning cohorts onsite to teach me Python and SAS which was a big plus. 2 hours later on my fourth round, I received a phone call with an offer.

    $90k + Performance Bonus. Amazing Health + Wealth Benefits. 4 weeks PTO and 10 Sick Days. 

I did not negotiate because I didn't have any leverage and it was wayyy more than I was making now. I also dreamed of working in the Financial Market and will be in a Division involving the Global Market.

# Final Thought and Future Plans

I would still recommend doing a Masters even with it's flaws. I know most Master program, such as this, are cash cows to make money for the School. Majority of my classmates were International Students paying full price and the other half are currently working and their company are paying for it.

I knew that I did not have the discipline to complete a Google Certification or DataCamp. Tuition was pricey but they gave me a 7% discount of tuition for a returning student (LMAO). Looking at past classmates LinkedIn, majority of them worked as Data Analyst and eventually as Data Scientist or Data Engineers.

If I would recommend anything, definitely have an outstanding resume, practice interviews, and communicate efficiently. I am a Introvert so I absolute hate doing Presentations and get anxious talking to people but it gets better slowly.

I know people would not recommend doing a Master's especially if you have no experience but at the end, it worked out for me. My future plan's is hopefully get into the Data Engineering field. I enjoy working with the databases and had a great relationship talking to the DE at the internship or even maybe a Sales Engineer lol.

Any advice?,,1636929648.0,Career Advice,56,1.0,"So I started this job 11 months ago. 1 month in, the boss that hired me was fired. 1 month later, my new boss resigned. At this point, I was drowning in work and didn’t even learn what most of my job was let alone both bosses. At this point, i’m doing 3 jobs in order to keep my own projects running. They tell me they will be getting somebody to help at least once a week. So for months I am fixing things, drowning in work and going to sleep with panic attacks. At one point I asked for less work or more pay and they laughed at me. I’m a relatively new analyst so I don’t know what’s acceptable. In September, one of my clients complains a Tableau dashboard is broken and I find out our database admin left and it was not being maintained. They never said a word or handed off the job. So now i’m doing about 5 jobs, including managing myself and my projects. I cannot fucking breathe and every day I finally finish I lay in bed sweating, panicking and crying.

Flash forward to Friday, I tell my boss i’m drowning in work and have no idea how to prioritize all these projects being dumped onto me. I’ve been saying i’m drowning in work for 9 months and this time he says, “I set up a 1 on 1 with my boss so we’re getting somebody soon”. At this point, I realize they never were getting anybody for the past 9 months and I was just being lied to so they could get me to keep the projects going myself.

dataanalysis,i4hqvn,"I think that focusing on the technology part of the job is great, but there needs to be an understanding of the business as well and how we as the analysts can add value to just about every department within the company",,1596674908.0,,56,0.97,"I've been subbed to this subreddit since I made the change full time into being a Data Analyst and I've noticed that there is a lot of focus on the technology, tools, languages, etc. I don't see a lot of information or questions regarding understanding the business or knowing how to add value outside of the standard workflow requests.

I come from an Accounting background mainly in 2 different sectors:

1. Financial

2. Manufacturing

I've worked in industries from banking to plastics, healthcare, agricultural equipment, truck trailer, automotive, etc. All of these business require radically different solutions and have hugely different questions regarding how to provide value to these respective organizations. No 2 companies in the same sector are going to have the same challenges. Just because 2 companies may be in the Energy sector, if one is fossil fuel (coal) and one is nuclear, you are going to have a totally different regulatory and compliance environment, expenses, metrics, etc.

Just about every department loops me into their meetings because management likes having a ""data expert"" in the room who can answer technical questions about using and reporting on the data. They also see the value in having someone who is curious about what goes on behind the scenes after the data is captured. I ask questions in every meeting about the data entry process, what data is important to who, what problems they are trying to solve, and what improvements their team has found so far and then what improvements I might be able to suggest. 

There needs to be a critical understanding of the company by the Analyst in how the company makes money, what its different lines of business are, who its major competitors are (peer group review), what challenges the business is currently facing or might be facing (COVID), and what improvements management thinks they can make to the company as a whole. It's important to have a sense of curiosity and interest in the business as well. Some of the questions I've asked and had discussions around performing analysis and trying to develop predictive analytics around are:

1. If our raw material costs at standard for a particular vehicle are $X and we have engineering changes that will change the BoM by $Y x 300,000 vehicles a year because of market demand, but will be equally offset in revenue, how do we explain the change in revenue estimations not only for next year's business plan, but also for our auditors as part of their revenue verification process AND verify the current take rates for that particular part on the model we produce now.

2. How can we accurately track inventory fluctuations (by part number) for RM, WIP, and FG items by matching them to our monthly production? IE inventory receipts, shop floor transactions and invoices. We also need to reduce inventory on hand by at least $1MM so we also need to develop an ongoing system to identify any unknown obsolete materials or slow moving materials we have on hand and track those accordingly so we can reserve appropriately.

3. We believe that the weights of the resins on our BoM's are off by at least 5%, we think they are too high and by adjusting the resin usage we can lower our material cost at standard. We need to collect weights, usage, and scrap on a sample of every molded part we make for this particular BoM configuration over the next 1-2 weeks. How can we prove that the changes we are proposing to make to the BoM will actually reduce our material cost at standard in the next 2 quarters and will not be offset as losses in inventory adjustments? What statistical analysis can we do to prove our theory correct regarding BoM weights?

4. Compared to our competitors we are the lowest performing company in regards to revenue generated in this particular business line. We need to understand what revenue we are generating, where it's coming from, where we have inefficiencies and what we can do to increase revenue in the markets we serve for this particular product. How can we pull together a comprehensive overview by product, region, salesperson, month (last 6 quarters), and any trends associated with those criteria?

These are just a small snippet of some of the business challenges that I've had to work with multiple different departments in the company with to solve. Yes, knowing how to access the data and using SQL to query it and Excel to build pivot tables and pivot charts or power BI to build interactive dashboards with drill-throughs or Python to create SPA's for management to review the KPI's are all important and definitely part of the job, but I just don't see a lot of focus on answering the business questions that management is trying to solve and that I think needs to be a pivotal focus because if I'm interviewing with a company I want management to know that I can add value from day one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/i4hqvn/i_think_that_focusing_on_the_technology_part_of/

I looked at the paid version (15,000 dollars) of the full time program and the program schedule said they will teach courses to help you get certified in things like tableau. 

I spoke to one of their admissions counselors after I got into the free program and she was very blunt. She said they won’t really help you get certified or make a strong portfolio. It was obvious that since this was a free program, they really weren’t trying to impress me.

dataanalysis,m7jye1,Google Certificates - My Opinion So Far 4/8 Courses Completed,MrTextAndDrive,1616045315.0,,57,1.0,"Hello all!

I'm currently exploring other career options. I got an advertisement on my google homepage for Google Certificates, checked it out, and signed up. I have very little experience with Data Analysis. I'm a 32 year-old American high school graduate with a basic understanding of Excel and Google Sheets, and had absolutely no prior knowledge of SQL, R, or really any aspects of what was involved in Data Analysis beyond what I read in job postings. ***I also want to say this is just my opinion so far, and my experience may not necessarily be the same for you.*** 

I signed up on March 14th. As of this post I have completed 4 courses (out of 8) in about ten hours. There are 8 courses in total, and each course is split into Weeks. The first week of the first course was so basic it frustrated my ADHD brain, ""So, what IS 'Data'?"" was a real question they answered... I know what data is. Everyone knows what data is. Right? But I sat through every second of every video. I did every journaling exercise, every quiz, etc., all the way through. And within an hour my first ""Week"" was finished. I moved onto the next ""Week"" of work. Then the next. I had finished the first month in about three hours, again, doing everything. At the end I figured, ""Ok, great, an intro for literally ANYONE!"" And I understood why the course started out as such. It was a bit frustrating and slow for me, but I moved on.

Then I started the second course: Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions. It was basically more of the same. It dealt with the subject of identifying and understanding how to figure out the right questions to solve given problems. But when I say it ""dealt with the subject"", that's pretty generous. Again, very generalized, very basic, to a shocking degree. I started skipping through videos and skimming the reading. I wanted to get to the REAL work. This pattern continued throughout the next two courses, albeit with some actual details on databases, SQL, and functions in Excel/Google Sheets in course 3 &4. Less than I'd hoped, but at a pace I feel anyone can follow.

In general the videos feel very... clinical. The speakers, can't figure out if they're actual actors or not, are hit or miss. But none so far are very compelling. The jokes are awful, but then that's not why we're here, and bad jokes are still funny for other reasons. I personally feel that if they update the course, they should focus on making these videos more informative and human. It's all a bit too stiff and corporate. I definitely enjoy that they have the entire transcript of the video available right underneath, though. You can click on a sentence and the video will play from that point, if you need. It makes for a fantastic option if for some reason you can watch but not listen for whatever reason. It's also great to skim the transcript to get the context of the video to see if it's worth your time if you want to move at an accelerated pace.

The ""Readings"" are probably the most informative portions to the coursework so far. Texts, charts, etc., about the subjects. Well written, clear, and concise, with good examples when necessary. Along with the glossaries I'd say this is the source of most of the true lesson.

There are these ""Journal"" portions I absolutely skip at this point. Personal reflections upon my goals aren't why I'm attempting to acquire this certificate. There's also discussion prompts which take you to the forums consisting of other participants in the coursework but I haven't participated yet. Once things get more difficult I'll dip my toe into that. Maybe.

The quizzes and tests are fine. They can be scenario based. There are links for you to download mock emails and datasheets to be able to answer the questions from the scenario, which I think is fantastic. Unfortunately, most of the time the answers are easily discerned without even looking at the mock data referenced in the question.  Most of the test questions are multiple choice, with the occasional ""Fill In The Blank"" type question. For example: ***""What is the correct LENGTH statement to use to find any text strings containing more than two characters? Type your answer below.""***

You can take quizzes repeatedly without penalty, and it keeps your highest score. Course tests however can only be taken 3 times without passing before you get an 8 hour timeout. I decided to explore how the testing works and there's a shocking lack of alternate questions, so often times you'll just get the same questions repeatedly if you didn't pass the first time. I'm unsure if that 8 hours starts ticking at the first attempt or the third... I'll check that out tomorrow maybe and edit this post. 

All in all, it's teaching a lot of extremely basic things, which I think is good, but I just don't feel challenged yet. I'm betting, and hoping, it'll ramp up in the coming courses. If you already have a basic understanding of what it means to be a Data Analyst, any knowledge of Excel/Google Sheets, and SQL, you'll breeze through even faster than I did. If you know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING except how to read with basic comprehension skills, type, click a mouse, and do some basic math, this course is within your reach. So I have to give credit there, this so far is for absolutely anyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/m7jye1/google_certificates_my_opinion_so_far_48_courses/
dataanalysis,jce4qp,I was useful with almost no experience,EntropicPencil,1602869157.0,,55,0.98,"tldr: I Used a three month lockdown to study data analysis, and was able to apply it to my job with the military. 

I work for the military, so this will be a little vague, but maybe someone will read this and see that you don't have to know everything to start doing useful analysis. I also kind of want to brag a little.

I was locked down for three months due to COVID and decided to study data analysis. I signed up for some online training, and downloaded a book on Pandas, and a couple of books on Python.

When I went back to work, I had some free time, so I started doing some ETL stuff. The military unit I work for uses Excel for everything, and I was able to make something useful out of the 15,000+ lines. The information and graphs were included in a report to the commanding general, and will be included in monthly reports from now on. 

I kept at it, and was able to start looking at ways to identify trends in certain activity. I noticed a steep decline in one area, and let the lead intel analyst know. I told him that we would have to explain the trend. He looked into it, and was able to explain the decline. The next day the general asked about that exact thing. Because I had brought it to the analyst's attention, he was able to answer the general's question on the spot. 

The total amount of code is about 1000 lines, and I know that are some huge inefficiencies, but I'm working on it. 

Things I learned:

1- Even though I could do the exercises in the training, when it came time to work on real data, I was almost completely lost. The main thing I got from the training was an understanding of what's possible. I had to go back and look up how to do most things. There was just too much hand-holding in the training. 

2 - It's okay to steal code, but you have to understand what it does. The code to identify trends was taken from stackoverflow, but I had to modify it to do what I needed, and then be able to explain what it was doing before anyone else agreed to at least kind of trust it. 

3 - More on stealing code: I had to understand the code in order to modify it. The code as written did not exactly fit my needs.

4 - This shit is fun.

5 - Don't skip the data munging. The Excel spreadsheets have misspellings, inconsistent spellings, spaces at the end, and missing data. 

6 - It isn't just about the data. I had a little bit of programming experience, but in order to really make something useful, I needed to understand the Python as well. 

7 - This post got a lot longer than I had planned, but I'm celebrating my birthday in a country that may or may not allow alcohol, so I may or may not be drinking illegally.

8 - You're going to run into things you didn't learn from the training. For example, I have to reindex by day, but that doesn't include days where no data was entered. In order to get accurate daily averages, I had to get the min and max dates and create a new index by that first. I had to do some more date stuff before looking at trends.

We can talk about what we're learning, and how we learned it, ask questions, do trivia or quizzes to check our skills, come up with project ideas, and even do projects together to put them in our resumes! (As I've mentioned I'm looking for people around the same level as me, so we can relate to each other's struggles without worrying about looking stupid lol) I think it'll be more personal than asking questions on Reddit.

I’ve been contemplating pursuing data analytics for a little while now. I currently have a Bachelor of Science in Public Health, so not a data analytics related degree. I’ve seen so many people online rave about the fact that you can “break into” data analytics by taking courses and certifications on SQL, python, and tableau. However, is this too good to be true?? Can one really become pretty proficient in these and *actually* break into data analytics without a related degree or entry level experience? I know learning these platforms would take a lot of time and dedication, which I’m willing to do.

Just wanted some opinions as far as how much I need to know from each data analysis 'knowledge prerequisites'.    
From my understanding they're SQL, Tableau/PowerBI, Python/R, and Excel/Sheets.    
I know you don't necessarily need to be a *master* with all of them, but just wanted some insight as to how much I would need to be comfortable with before applying and/or how much can be learned once I have the position. 

Can anyone give a rough estimate on what should be known from each of these categories before applying? I'll list where I'm at with each below if anyone has any insight on that as well. 

* I completed the Google Data Analysis course. From what I understand it doesn't really hold that much weight, but was a good starting point as someone coming from a completely different field. 
I also have a lot of the soft skills that seem to be wanted. Communication, working with a team, things like that. 

* Sheets - I took a 'course' for Google Sheets that focused on things that would be used for data analysis. I say 'course' because it was just a youtube learning series, so not able to write something like ""Completed XYZ Excel Data Analysis Course"". I feel pretty comfortable using it to manipulate/clean data. 

* SQL - I'm currently about midway through the Mosh SQL course. I am familiar with the basics of SQL including joins, and the basic clauses/operators. I've also gone though Stratascratch and done almost all of the 'easy' interview questions. Then will start working on the 'medium' ones. 

* Tableau - I use Tableau public and have taken sample datasets and created basic visualizations and dashboards. They're not fancy, just basic graphs, but I can easily explain what they are and what they mean as a whole. I am not familiar at all using PowerBI. 

* Python/R - No experience at all.

If you can't find this person, reach out to anyone in the campaign and ask if they know who to talk to.

Anyone have any tips? The job is in the domain I come from but will be my first analyst role. 

I know the basics of vlookup and pivot tables and have been learning about power query just to up my knowledge. Anything else I should focus on?

**UPDATE:** (one week later) The test was 30 minutes and included an Excel workbook with 3 sheets. Three tasks. First task was to create a column that indicated if a value in another column was less than or greater than a certain value (IF functions). 

Second task was to get certain columns from two of the sheets onto the third. Easy VLOOKUP stuff and they even specified which column to use as the key. 

Third task was to create a pivot table that included a specific filter and calculation.

All in all very easy. I made a huge mistake and submitted it with half of the sheet filtered out. Was sure that mistake cost me the job and really beat myself up over it. Was shocked when they called me again. Turns out they didn’t even notice and said I did a great job.

I don’t do data visualizations, I don’t do any sort of analyses at all. I really never deal with any math or statistics at all.

I have been learning SQL on and off over the past few months and recently just completed a few courses including joins on DataCamp.

Once a course is completed, you are 'awarded' a certification of completion. Are these certs worth putting on your LinkedIn profile under 'Licenses & certifications' and resume when applying for jobs or is this essentially useless? 

When applying for jobs, some online applications ask for linkedin profile url. Again, would these datacamp certs be worth placing on your linkedin and resume since it 'proves' that I know SQL joins as well as just general visibility for recruiters for example or should I just leave this off since it does not count for actual real world experience, etc.?

What has been your general experience with this? Graduated w/ a BS in Biology from a few years back and currently work a non-IT related job in healthcare right now but am looking to potentially transition into an analyst role and I live in/near a very large city in the USA by the way if that matters.

I just looked at the other posts on here, which had advice about using analytics in your current role (I'm a housewife and freelance writer so that's not very likely) and making connections in your business life, which I also can't see a way to do.

So i'm left sitting here at my desk while the kids are at school wondering if I have a good enough chance of getting into a career in data analytics, or if I should just give up and be a substitute teacher for near minimum wage.

They are a manufacturer company (they produce lenses). They want me to help them with both their data (analysis and models/projections) and to use that data to get them new clients. 

I think this job is for more than one person since there are many things to do. But this is indeed a good opportunity for me and I’ll get good experience. 

I’m in need of guidance, I always thought my first job would be under the wing of a data specialist that would tell me what to do, but my employers expect me to do this be myself. 

I want to be realistic in what I can do for them, and I need to organize myself: Where do you think I should start with ? What data should I be asking of them ?

After reading this book, you will know the basics of supervised learning, understand complex mathematical models, understand the entire pipeline of a typical ML project, and also be able to share your knowledge with colleagues from related industries and with technical professionals.

And for those who find the theoretical part not enough - I supplemented the book with a repository on **GitHub**, which has Python implementation of every method and algorithm that I describe in each chapter ([https://github.com/5x12/themlsbook](https://github.com/5x12/themlsbook)).

I was a Planning and Analysis Manager a decade ago and took the course to get back into being a Data Analyst after a decade in marketing, martial arts, travel, and other projects. I found that my personality and skillset are best suited for working more on my own as an analyst.

I took the course to brush up on my skills and learn new ones. I watched a number of Youtube videos on how great the course is for getting into Data Analytics. Most of those videos have affiliate marketing links and aren't an unbiased take on the course and many of the people making reviews likely didn't take the course.

Here are some of my thoughts and observations.

The course says it takes 240 hours to complete. I think it could be done in 80 to 100 hours while watching all the videos in each course, doing the learning logs, practice problems, and capstone. If you are a college student on break, just bite the bullet and knock it out in 2 to 3 weeks. If you are a full-time professional, put in 10 hours a week and knock it out in 2 months.

If you are new to data analysis, the background, thought process, how to present findings, ideas, and career advice are very helpful. You can get much of the same advice from other online sources as well. If you have experience, you are basically doing the course for the certificate and picking up some new tricks and tips.

The technical aspects on Excel are solid. The Tableau, SQL and R are very basic. Anybody who takes the course as a beginner will need to learn a lot more Tableau, Excel, SQL, R or Python in order to really prepare themselves for a data analyst role. Also, depending on field, AWS, Salesforce, Google Analytics Tags, etc.

I have seen some people on here post their gripes about the course. Its a great start, almost like a Data Analytics 101 class, but then you have to challenge yourself to take the 200, 300 and 400 level classes in Tableau, Python, R, SQL, and Excel to build upon that foundation. Networking and building a portfolio are important as well. As you learn something new in SQL, or tableau take on a new project while the learning is fresh and pop it up on your portfolio.

The certificate and course aren't a silver bullet or magical. Its just the initial foundation that will require a lot more time, energy and work to learn, build a portfolio, networking, and apply for jobs. Its just the start, not even close to the finish.

Also, I looked at the job postings within the Google Data Analytics job site. Most of the jobs aren't entry level and a number of them require Bachelors or Masters in STEM fields.

After couple of months of self learning, finally got my first position as a Junior Data Analyst. 

The thing is that the Data team organization is a bit weird. The DA aren’t really part of the Data team but rather part of the business units (I am a Data Analyst part of the Ops team for example, we got guys in the Marketing, Finance etc) 

The only folks who are part of the Data team are Data Engineers / Scientists since they work on transversal projects (that’s how they explain that) 

It’s difficult because I am the only DA (on top of that Junior) in my team and I feel like I am disturbing people (Data guys) from other teams when I need an advice. They don’t really know my data/tables and it’s always difficult to interact with them about my struggles. 

Moreover, as I am the only Junior DA in my team, I take dozens of requests every time and I just can’t handle everything. It’s a good learning curve, but sometimes I don’t even feel legitimate enough to refuse/challenge their ideas, since the requests come from the management. 

I feel overwhelmed even though I feel I can do it and have the competencies to do my work, but I just struggle and feel constant stress. There is nobody to challenge my data modeling practices / my code etc. I am just delivering something that works.

My name is Keaton, and I'm 32, American, and a male. I have a bachelor's degree from an American university, but it is not in a tech-related field. In January of this year, I started to pivot myself toward a career change. I've been working in education for the past 10+ years, and I've really enjoyed it, but my time in this space is coming to an end. I've been living and working abroad for the past 2.5 years, but this summer (2022), I think I'm finally planning on coming home and changing careers. I'd like to transition into the tech space. Based on what I've read and learned, my biggest areas of interest are data analysis, full-stack web development, and cybersecurity. So far, I've mainly focused on the first two areas as I don't feel that I'm ready to tackle learning cybersecurity, and I definitely find myself favoring data analysis over full-stack web development. The learning path seems much clearer to me, and I find it more interesting overall. Also, I think a lot of my soft skills, including critical thinking, research, presentation, and project planning, will translate well into data analysis.

Here's my current learning plan. I'm trying to get a solid foundation in the skill/knowledge area before moving on to the next one:

1). SQL

2). Spreadsheets

3). Visualization Tools

4). General Theory/Statistics

5). Python

6). R

To this end, I'm using a few resources, including Coursera, Datacamp, W3, and FreeCodeCamp (among others). Of these sources, I'm really enjoying Datacamp. They have many courses, all of which are approximately 4-5 hours in length, that cover plenty of topics with exercises included. They also have projects, which I plan on diving into once my skills are up to par. Datacamp recently offered a year-long subscription at a discount of more than 50%, so I pulled the trigger.

Anyway, I'm reaching out to see if anyone is interested in partnering up with me, primarily for projects and for sharing resources and for job hunting, over the next 6-18 months. As of right now, I don't feel project-ready -- I think I'll need a few more months of self-study -- but I'm fully committed to completing them and adding them to my portfolio. Please note that I do work a full-time job, so at most, I can commit 2-3 hours per day to data analysis. Also, I live in Asia, so my time zone is 12-15 hours ahead of the U.S.

As with anything, I think it would be easier to work with others who are equally motivated. Whether you are an aspiring data analyst like me or someone with experience in the space, please let me know if you'd be interested. Perhaps we could create a Discord or something and work from there? I think a group of 3-5 people would be ideal, but I'm open-minded. Who knows -- maybe all of us will even become good life-long friends?

My personal interests are myriad -- gaming, exercise, education, sports, entertainment (e.g. comic books, films, t.v. shows), music, languages, personal finance, and many more -- so if we share any interests and we could create a project around one or more of them, that'd be great!

Anyway, thanks for reading. I hope to hear from some of you, either in comments below or in my message inbox!

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks for all of the positive feedback and responses. I've read all of them and taken into account what was said. Based on what I've read, I've made TWO (2) decisions.

(1). Someone mentioned a Discord community called Dataxp ([https://www.dataxp.ai/](https://www.dataxp.ai/)). I joined this community and realized that it's better and more comprehensive than anything that I could hope to make. Therefore, I encourage all of you to join this group.

(2). That being said, if any of you are still interested in partnering in a smaller Discord group to share learning resources, discuss projects/portfolios, network, and collaborate, I still made a server. I'm NOT a Discord expert and don't have a lot of time to research how to create the best possible server, so the server won't have a lot of bells and whistles, but it should serve for now.

dataanalysis,otun9m,Getting a job in the data field with no degree or background,alienprincee,1627553469.0,,41,0.96,"Hey everyone,

&#x200B;

So a little background on me. I'm 29 years old, getting close to 30. I'm not happy at all with where my life is at right now, stuck at a retail job slinging out coffee to busy professionals. I've stumbled upon this role through my countless hours of researching jobs in tech, and it stuck out to me because I felt like it ticked a lot of boxes for what I'm naturally inclined and interested in. Plus, it did not feel as coding heavy as supposed to a web developer. I get that some of you may laugh at that last statement.

I get that coding will be a part of it, maybe even a large part of it, but it does not seem like it's the bread and butter of what a data analyst needs compared to an actual coder.

Anyways, let's get straight to the point. As the title states, I have no background in this field. I have a degree in art and painting and have taken no statistics or mathematical course ever during my time in college.

Currently, I'm working through the Google Data Analytics Certificate program, hoping this can open some doors for me once I get it. However,  I'm fully aware that a young newly minted college grad with a degree in CS or DA, is still going be a way more attractive option than a 30 year old with a certificate.

In addition, to taking the Google DA course, I'm learning as much as I can about Excel and SQL through YouTube videos, Khan Academy, Coursera, etc.

My current skill stack I would say is:

Excel: Beginner to Lower Intermediate

SQL: Beginner

Python: Beginner

Tablue: Only just started

&#x200B;

I'm desperate to get out of retail, but I would love to get at least a small taste of the data world. I know I will never be able to get an actual Data Analyst role now, but is there a role below DA that I can potentially get into? I've been looking at Data Entry roles, though I'm not sure if that is relevant? Plus, that job in specific is disappearing fast since entry is easy to automate.

If there is no entry into the field as of now, then I would love some recommendations as to what else I need to learn to supplement my certificate. Will I need more than the four skills I've outlined previously? Lastly, one thing similar to the art world that Data Analytics has in common, is having a portfolio. Can certain Excel projects be used to demonstrate my skills and be a part of my portfolio during interviews? Or, are we talking about well laid out dashboards, or perhaps SQL databases that may be more impressive?

Any help would be appreciated! Little tree sprout hoping to find his roots in a better field!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/otun9m/getting_a_job_in_the_data_field_with_no_degree_or/

However, once other companies started paying significantly more  AND offered 100% remote options that advantage went out the window and people have been leaving in droves.

The big challenge is in filling the positions.  They can fill the manager positions internally (even with people who have no analytics experience), but are having a heck of a time replacing the senior analysts.

dataanalysis,zrb01s,I did it. Offer accepted today. Here's my story and advice.,svtbuckeye11,1671599243.0,Career Advice,37,1.0,"Get ready for a long one guys as I want to lay out my journey from starting in this field and how I did it to hopefully help you all in your job search as well.

Background:

I think I may have a bit of a different background to most posts I've seen looking for help on this sub, but not by any means unique. I graduated college in the beginning of 2011 with a degree in Business Management with a focus in Finance, specifically business valuation and investments. Out of college I struggled to get a job in the field of that degree so opted to enter an industry I love, automotive in this case. I started working an retailer and quickly worked my way up at the store level and stayed there for nearly a decade. A better opportunity came up at a local dealership and I held both a sales and service role there until the pandemic started, when I was laid off. At that time my first child was just a few months old so this, in a way, was a blessing in disguise and gave me the opportunity to stay at home with them. Throughout my time at home I knew I would eventually need to go back to the workplace as the kids (we had a second), grew up and would end up going to school/daycare. I reverted back to some of the things that interested me in college which was the valuation part of my degree and using programs like R and Excel to come to conclusions. As I researched options, DA came up quite often and I decided to take advantage of the Google Data Analytics course and see how it peaked my interest.

Data Analyst Process:

Upon completion, my interest was most definitely peaked and I started to apply for jobs and continue taking some of the other courses to polish and expand on my skills. I was spending anywhere from three to four, to as much as 8 hours a day practicing and working on the courses I was taking, while again, constantly applying for jobs. As I was working through, I was consuming YT content on how to brake into this career field and learned quite a few things. Optimizing your LinkedIn profile and resume were key in my case. I was about to shift from coursework to building a portfolio when I started getting approached by some recruiters through LinkedIn, some of which were bogus or had very poor reviews. Being that this part started in early November, the process was quite slow due to the upcoming holiday and that some of the legit offers were companies in which the year-end holiday's were their ""busy season"". So for context, the opportunity I took, my initial contact with the recruiter was early to mid November, and I just accepted the offer today, and it is a bit above the average pay range.

Conclusion:

My biggest piece of advice is, if you are serious about this career and are passionate about the work you will be doing, NOT the pay, keep at it and continue to practice and learn new skills, and don't be complacent with your image in the career networking space.  Continually evolve and take in new advice and information to better present yourself to employers. In my case, I applied to over 170-180 jobs according to my log, which I'm sure I didn't include some. I would say I officially began my job search in early August of this year, so it does take time if you are also in a career shift like I am. There were a couple opportunities I passed on because they were a great fit for the season of life I'm in, but as much as you can, don't sacrifice or cut yourself short too much when considering an offer. If it's not right, it's not right.

Lastly, regardless of your previous experience, find a way to relate it to Data Analysis. Use and practice the STAR method on in your resume and in interviews. If you don't know, in general, it means 'what was the problem, what was your approach, and what were the results. Even if you don't think the first call you get is the right fit, use it as a chance to practice your interview skills. You can always say ""No"".

I hope this helps one of you out there. Special thanks to a lot of you who got their shot before me and made a post like this discussing their experience. It was a big help and made me think differently as I hadn't had to look for a job in nearly 15 years. If you all need help, I'm willing to. as much as I can, reply with advice to your specific situation either through DM's or replies. Either way, good luck and keep slaying it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/zrb01s/i_did_it_offer_accepted_today_heres_my_story_and/

First, there is no tool for everyone in a company who wants quickly get answers by themselves. Excel is familiar to almost everyone, but the data size limit, data accessibility, organization of transformations, and collaboration capability are not good enough. Second,  the data team is exhausted by the shit mountain of the SQL and other data transformation codes. Besides, the unclear requirements in emails, talking, and documents from business teams also are dragging down the data team. They have no time to do more valuable work such as improving infrastructures, data quality, data governance, etc.

Last year, my best friends and I started building a data tool that everyone could access and deal with large datasets (up to GB-level by now) without technical support in a spreadsheet-like UI.

Moreover, our product can automatically translate the data transformations to SQL compatible with many databases, data warehouses, and data lakes.

Would anyone be interested in giving it a spin? We have upgraded the product several times based on our initial test users' suggestions and got positive feedback from a big company in real and complex use cases. Now, we want to get more advice and feedback.

Now what?,oscarb1233,1651733762.0,Data Analysis Tutorial,36,0.97,"This is the content of my blog post at [https://oscarbaruffa.com/step0/](https://oscarbaruffa.com/step0/). I've seen a few people ask about how to start analysing data and I think this will help.

EDIT: I've added detailed descriptions of each item.

\---------------------------------------

If you’re new to Data Analysis… Welcome! Glad you have you :).

People learn data analysis skills in different ways. Maybe you’ve done some courses, tutorials, certifications or even a whole degree. You’re either working on creating a portfolio or you’ve received your very first dataset and real world questions to answer  – congratulations!

At this point, it can be totally normal to think: 

>*“Ok, how do I begin analysing this dataset? How exactly am I supposed to start? Help!”*

Cue some mild panic and hint of existential dread.

I’ve seen many a reddit-thread where people feel lost without the structure of learning material to guide them. It can be easy to feel like you’re not making any progress in your learning when you stumble at the very start of applying your knowledge in the real world. 

When you first receive a dataset outside of a structured course, it can be really confusing about where to start because you could start anywhere, and you could head in any direction. 

>*Don’t worry – you’ve got this!*

Whatever training you’ve had up until now will move you forward in your analysis. What I’ll help you with today is not Step 1 of your analysis, but what I think of as Step 0 – Getting to know your dataset. 

It’s tempting to dive straight into analyses because it feels like it’s the “real work” but rest-assured, getting to know your dataset IS real work and will pay off massively in steering your analyses to useful results. You’ll be able to provide others with guidance on what questions can or can’t be answered and you’ll have a better idea of how to interpret the results. 

What I’ll present you with here is a checklist of ways in which you can get to know the dataset you’re working with. Take this with you in your first, fiftieth or hundred-and-fiftieth analysis – it’ll always work. The more you can check off, the better your understanding of the data and analyses will be. As you gain experience a lot of this will become second nature. 

The basis of this approach is to give you a solid mental reference point of the data and will be your first mental model of what it represents. Once you’ve got this reference point, you’ll feel a lot more confident about what step 1 of your analysis should be. It’s like finding a landmark in an unfamiliar part of town and suddenly you have a better idea about where you are and what direction you should be going. 

 

The basis of this approach is to give you a solid mental reference point of the data and will be your first mental model of what it represents. Once you’ve got this reference point, you’ll feel a lot more confident about what step 1 of your analysis should be. It’s like finding a landmark in an unfamiliar part of town and suddenly you have a better idea about where you are and what direction you should be going. 

Use the table of contents below as a checklist and then read on for more detailed descriptions of each.

* Storage format
* File size (kB, MB, GB)
* Number of rows and columns
* Data types
* Quick scan of first 10 rows
* Age of dataset and how often it’s updated
* Purpose of the dataset
* Who uses it now?
* How was the data collected?
* For databases, where is the ERD?
* Is there a data dictionary? Does it look accurate?
* How descriptive are the headers?
* Who is the custodian of the dataset? How are they maintaining it?
* Do the headers match the data in them?
* How much of the data is missing?
* Can you see numbers like 999, 9999 in values?
* Cleanliness rating
* Distribution of values, counts, averages, min/max
* Verify with a domain expert

This advice is based on my own experience, but is by no means exhaustive. People who work with different datasets than I do will have different views, but I think this applies well to many situations. 

### Storage format

I’d expect most datasets, if presented in a file, to be in a CSV (Comma Separated Variables) or Excel (XLS or XLSX) format. 

If there’s some other weird or proprietary format that I don’t recognise, that would indicate I might have trouble opening the file, reading the contents correctly or finding help on issues and I may have to budget in extra time for converting the file, or finding a way of converting it to a more usable format. 

### File size (kB, MB, GB)

I’d expect smaller datasets to have smaller file sizes, and larger ones to have larger. Most datasets in files I’ve dealt with are in the 1- 50MB range. If I saw an excel file with over 100MB, I’d know there’s a lot going on in that workbook that could make working with it tricky. There’s probably a lot of formulas or analysis happening and I would see if I can separate out just the data I need into a new workbook or CSV. 

Large excel files can be temperamental and have a habit of crashing systems or being very slow to load. An excel file can become corrupted at any time. 

Anything geospatial, especially satellite imagery, can be very large.  If you see file sizes in the GB range, its very likely you’ll need more specialised ways of working with it. It’s good to research how to handle such large files for your needs. For example with satellite imagery, you may need to work via cloud-based virtual machines and some sort of distributed storage and processing (I’m guessing). For CSVs, you may need particular plugins or packages that can access this data without crashing your system. 

### Number of rows and columns

So, how many rows and columns are we looking at? 500 rows? 5 000? 500 000? The order of magnitude will give me a sense of how much data has been collected and what might be possible to analyse in a few scenarios. 

Example: If I was given a dataset of the income streams of all adults in the USA, but it only  had 500 rows of data I’d know it’s likely a dataset of aggregations, and I won’t be able to dive into very granular analysis.

Example: If this dataset were the spending habits of several families over the course of a few years, and there were 500 000 rows, I’d immediately think that this is probably extremely granular detail and there’ll be a lot of angles to look at. 

When it comes to columns (the variables), then a high number of them might tell me a few things. Firstly I expect there to be much fewer columns (variables) vs rows (observations). Let’s say 10, 20 or maybe even 50 columns. When it starts going higher, like 200 columns – that would give me cause for concern in that either the data isn’t structured well, or there’s metadata incorporated into the column names perhaps (harder to extract meaning). Of course there are many exceptions to this but they are more unusual than usual. 

### Data types

What data is contained in each column? Are they mostly numeric (decimals, whole numbers), text (free text, categories), dates and/times (formatting?), true/false (boolean). 

Are the datatypes correct e.g. is a date column actually have the date in it formatted as a date (22-01-2019) or is it actually text (string) format of the date (in which case there could be issues and errors when that was converted)? Does the formatting match what you’d expect e.g. if there’s meant to be a column (variable) with numerical data, is it really a number (e.g. 6000) or a text representation of that (“6k”) – assuming it’s not the spreadsheet software’s own visual formatting that you’re looking at. 

In short, if the data types match the data each column (variable) is meant to contain, you’re off to a good start. If not, tread carefully. 

### Quick scan of first 10 rows

Have a look at the data in the first 10 or 50 or 100 rows and scan over it. Does this data make any sense? Hopefully it will. Are numbers in the same order of magnitude as you’d expect? Are there any easy to spot correlations that make sense? For a dataset on personal wealth you might expect rows (observations) with high salaries to also have high home values.  

### Age of dataset and how often it’s updated

Datasets might be a live stream of information or as in many cases, it’s static and published on a specific date. Static datasets might be updated in a number of ways:

* Repeatedly updated and published as new datasets
* Single dataset gets updated i.e. there aren’t separate files published for each update
* Regular scheduled updates
* Scheduled updates that never end up happening (project is abandoned)
* Updates that happen but only for a specific period with a known or eventual end to the updates. 

And then some datasets are never updated, they were always meant to be a one-time publication.

The age of the dataset will often matter, because you need to gauge how useful the dataset is based on whether it’s outdated for your needs. 

If I want to estimate how many ice cream parlours could be supported by communities in a region, I would need relatively recent census data. Population estimates from 50 years ago would likely not be very useful for me today – for this particular analysis. 

Knowing the age of the dataset and how often it gets updated go hand-in-hand when it comes to being able to provide advice on how reliable the analysis might be, whether you can repeat the analysis in future and what follow up questions can be answered. 

### Purpose of the dataset

When the data was collected, what was the initial purpose? The more aligned that original purpose is with your current needs, the more useful that dataset is likely to be. 

Assume I want to help figure out the prevalence of stray dogs in a city and their effect on public health. A dataset (or datasets) that were collected specifically targeting the same questions, holding information like dog bite injuries in ER, prevalence of rabies, animal control callouts might all be more useful than related datasets of dog licence registration that only tell how many licenced pets there are in different areas. 

### Who uses it now?

This may or may not be tied to the original purpose of the dataset, but understanding who currently uses the dataset (if anyone) will be useful to know from a few angles, but primarily I like to know who I could ask questions of and what future developments might be coming. Perhaps there’s a sales team that uses the data extensively in dashboards and reports. If you know that they’re shifting strategy to measure targets that require new data to be captured in the database, maybe existing data points will be retired.

### How was the data collected?

Is this survey data? Online collection or in person? Trained enumerators or volunteers? Device data from web analytics? Email tracking pixels? Telemetry data from automated systems? Was there data validation upon entry or capture? Has the data gone through any cleaning or preparation between the point of collection and now?

The answers to these questions may be hard to get and you’ll probably pick up bits of information about each dataset as you work with it and gain experience. Over time you’ll get a good overview of how data flows from the point of capture to being ready for analysis, and all the ways it might get lost, changed or how it must be interpreted slightly (or very) differently from what the header, code book or data dictionary specifies. 

Take survey data for example. The same question being asked might be responded to very differently depending on factors like whether it was an in-person or online self-completed questionnaire, whether participants were incentivised to answer or not, whether they were asked in their own language or via translation, from a trained professional enumerator or from an untrained volunteer, in the presence of others or alone, anonymously or not.

### For databases, where is the ERD?

The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is key in understanding a database, the tables, fields and datatypes present and how they all relate to one another. 

This goes well together with a Data Dictionary. 

### Is there a data dictionary? Does it look accurate?

A data dictionary will give more detail on the ERD and be easier to search and navigate as it’s in document form, but ideally the data dictionary and ERD go hand in hand. Many databases do not come with a database dictionary but creating one and keeping it updated can be one of your first really valuable additions to any team. 

### How descriptive are the headers?

If the headers have very descriptive names, like “device” , “address”, “owner” you’re going to have a much easier time figuring out what the data is saying  than if you have “XB206\_XT”. Non-obvious headings will take a while to figure out and hopefully there is some pattern to their naming convention, but this is not always the case. 

### Who is the custodian of the dataset? How are they maintaining it?

Whose responsibility is it to maintain the dataset? Who looks after it? What do they do to maintain consistency between updates? How strict are the protocols for ensuring headers retain consistent meanings (hopefully very strict!). These questions help you identify how much trust you can put in the analyses you produce. It’s not unheard of, and not even that uncommon, for datasets to not be properly governed, with definitions and input requirements changing without any control – leading to someone needing a lot of tacit knowledge passed down from one analyst to another to avoid non-obvious issues. 

### Do the headers match the data in them?

It can happen that somewhere in data capture or transformation from to the dataset you’re seeing that something has happened which assigned the wrong column name (variable header) to the wrong column (variable) , so it’s worth a quick check to see if “First Name” actually looks like it contains people names, and not maybe a street address for example. 

I haven’t seen this happen often, but I have seen it.

### How much of the data is missing?

For each variable, check how many of the rows have data for it. In most cases, you want there to be very little (or no) missing data. In other cases, you may expect that a lot of data is missing. This check is really critical because it will have a large impact on what it is you can actually analyse. 

If a dataset of 20 000 train delays only has the train operator completed for 200 of those records, then it’s unlikely you can perform any meaningful analysis comparing train operator performance. 

### Can you see numbers like 999, 9999 in values?

Sometimes when numerical data is being captured, there’s a need to capture that the data is missing for one or more reasons, and then numbers like “999” or “9999” or something similar are used to denote that it’s missing for a specific reason  – as opposed to an NA value which might mean it’s was just never collected, asked for or available. . 

These uses of actual numbers as a form of additional data representation inside a variable that houses regular numeric data can skew your analysis results if you don’t filter them out and it’s not obvious that they’re there – you’ll have to look for them. 

Sometimes you’ll have a code book or a data dictionary that goes along with the dataset which should hopefully highlight that these values exist and what they denote. 

A similar occurrence in geographic coordinates is the use of 0 latitude and 0 longitude, referred to as “[Null Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Island)”.

### Cleanliness rating

How clean the data needs will change from one analysis to another, but you will encounter many datasets that are quite “dirty” and need a lot of cleaning before you can make them work. What do I mean by dirty data and what does cleaning it involve?

There are countless ways in which data can be dirty, but I’ll list some common ones that come to mind. 

* Free text entry where a dropdown options should have been used. You’ll find countless spelling variations of “Mississippi” and you’ll need to transform them all to the correct spelling. 
* Dates and times captured in different formats need alignment.
* Wrong data types captured e.g. numbers are stored as text and need to be converted. 
* Values entered in the wrong order of magnitude e.g data is captured in metric tonnes rather than kilograms. 
* Some values don’t make sense e.g.  a person’s age is 300 years old and that has to be removed. 
* Issues in recoding of special characters in text &quo& and must be removed or  converted back to it’s original representation. 

This is just a taste of some of the issues you’ll face. Personally I find sleuthing and cleaning quite enjoyable but this is often a key reason why just being able to jump into an analysis right away is not possible. You need to build in some allowance for data cleaning.

### Distribution of values, counts, averages, min/max

This will be your first look at the range of data available. For each variable, look at the frequency of values, the distribution of maximum and minimum values and the interquartile ranges. You may even want to have a first look at the correlation of any variables that you think should be obviously correlated. 

This is how I get a feel for the “size and shape” of this data and how much variation there is. In some cases you might expect lots of variation, or might expect very little – or have no expectation at all. That’s ok – you’re just familiarising yourself with the landscape. 

### Verify with a domain expert

Once you’ve got a feel for the dataset, it helps to verify some of your initial findings with a domain expert i.e. someone who is familiar with the content (or “business” side). If you were looking at facilities data, it would be good to check with the Facilities Manager if what you’re finding looks correct. For example, the Facilities Manager might know that there’s a lot of renovation work that’s happened but no one from the admin team have been recording the changes, so most of the data is likely right (building location, footprint size, utility providers etc) but there’ll be some data that’s probably wrong or out of date (value of fixtures and fittings, high risk materials, state of fire suppression systems to name a few).

## Now you know your data!

Having just completed some or all of the checklist, you’ll be one of the few people on earth who understands this dataset as well as you do! 

You’re in a good position to start analysing this data – either by answering questions you’ve been asked or by following the sparks of interest you’ve just had. 

And did you notice something? You’ve actually already begun the analysis! Missing values, distributions, counts, averages – all are useful and valuable info. Even answers like “I don’t know / It’s hard to say” are useful outcomes of the exercise. They’ll inform discussions about the way forward.

Started this job in May. Was a huge opportunity for me in a career sense as it was a big step up, and also a major step up in terms of pay. My previous role was a general marketing insights executive, working under my senior manager. I would do things like take survey outputs and identify themes over what people were saying, or comparing different customer types across various sentiments i.e. very basic data analysis. I've got 1.5 years of professional experience up to taking this job.

The first interview with this company they asked me had I done the technical aspect to the job (working with/ building reporting dashboards) to which I gave a vague yes (working with) but no (have not built) answer. The second round interview was a 20 min chat with the CPO that didn't test anything on my ability to do the role. Applied not really thinking I would get the job but lo and behold I got the offer after the 2 interviews.

Now 3 months into the job I can't shake the feeling that I have a major skills gap in what's required to do this role successfully. I keep trying to make workarounds to the reports via Excel that really need SQL/ Data Studio expertise which I am slowly learning, but do not have full analyst proficiency at present.

This is a new role that the company has never had before as they are a startup that's only starting to mature now. There is no one senior above me so I'm pretty much on my own when it comes to questions.

Have thought about enrolling in online data analysis courses to try and bridge the gap myself which I definitely think can play a part, but I think without someone senior to report into there will always be a gap that I cannot fill. It's starting to make me anxious as I don't want to be a deadweight team member but I also worry that I may have misrepresented myself during the interview process with the technical yes/no answer.

My boss hasn't said anything to make me feel like I could be let go anytime soon but I have asked him for some feedback as we approach the 3 month mark which is scheduled for 2 weeks time. I've voiced before in our 121's that I do feel a level of discomfort with the difference in my skills gap and the ambiguity of a startup (my previous job was the established BigCorp they are disrupting) and my boss has said that this will go away with time, but it has not.

All of this is really starting to take a toll on how competent I feel at work. This is a very technical job which I have never done before. I feel like I could get there with the right training and senior support but I also think that maybe this just isn't for me and I should quit.

Should I tell my boss I'm feeling this way or just try my best to fake it (data analyst courses outside of work hours) till I make it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/wb6ylf/3_months_into_this_insights_analyst_role_and_i/

* Decision Trees and Random Forest
* SVM
* KNN
* Clustering
* Boosting
* Dimension Reduction (PCA, LDA, Factor Analysis)

Those are pretty weak credentials, and I'm sure I'm not the only person with that kind of background that starts the job search thinking there's no chance anyone would ever hire me.

I wanted to share what worked for me, just in case it can work for anybody else.

Basically, it's this:

**Treat the job interview like you're selling a service**

What worked for me was to stop thinking of it as a job interview.

Instead, imagine that you're the sales rep for a Data company answering an RFP. A client has a problem and they need a solution. You're just there to demonstrate that you can implement it.

Try to figure out what problem they're trying to solve with this role before the interview begins. That might be something like: ""We have data but we don't know how to get meaning out of it"" or ""We need to re-architect our data"" or even just: ""We have a guy who does a great job, but we need two of him.""

Center everything you say around the key message of: ""I know what your problem is and I know how to solve it.""

When they ask you to tell them about yourself:

1. Focus your answer on demonstrating that you have experience solving problems like theirs
2. Wrap it up by saying you were interested in the job because you got the impression that they need that problem solved, and you have a lot of experience solving that problem
3. Ask the interviewer if you're on the right about what problem they need solved

It's fine if you've totally misread the company. The point is that, when you ask that question, early in the interview, you force the interviewer to explain what they want the person who takes the role to be able to do.

It also switches the whole dynamic of the interview. Instead of them asking you questions, it's now about you troubleshooting that problem.

Respond by:

1. Asking clarifying questions about the problem they have
2. Explaining how you would approach the problem
3. Describing past similar projects you've worked on and how you solved them
4. Highlighting the business impact of your solutions

Doing this made a *massive* difference in my job search. I didn't hear back from any job I applied to until I tried this approach, but I heard back from everybody after I did.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/umse6v/i_got_4_data_science_job_offers_with_salaries/

datascience,qph4tx,How to get a job in data science - a semi-harsh Q/A guide.,save_the_panda_bears,1636388717.0,Job Search,1522,0.96,"**HOW DO I GET A JOB IN DATA SCIENCE?**

Hey you. Yes you, person asking ""how do I get a job in data science/analytics/MLE/AI whatever BS job with data in the title?"". I got news for you. There are two simple rules to getting one of these jobs.

1. Have experience.

2. Don't have no experience.

There are approximately 1000 entry level candidates who think they're qualified because they did a 24 week bootcamp for every entry level job. I don't need to be a statistician to tell you your odds of landing one of these aren't great.

**HOW DO I GET EXPERIENCE?**

Are you currently employed? If not, get a job. If you are, figure out a way to apply data science in your job, then put it on your resume. Mega bonus points here if you can figure out a way to attribute a dollar value to your contribution. Talk to your supervisor about career aspirations at year-end/mid-year reviews. Maybe you'll find a way to transfer to a role internally and skip the whole resume ignoring phase. Alternatively, network. Be friends with people who are in the roles you want to be in, maybe they'll help you find a job at their company.

**WHY AM I NOT GETTING INTERVIEWS?**

IDK. Maybe you don't have the required experience. Maybe there are 500+ other people applying for the same position. Maybe your resume stinks. If you're getting 1/20 response rate, you're doing great. Quit whining. 

**IS XYZ DEGREE GOOD FOR DATA SCIENCE?**

Does your degree involve some sort of non-remedial math higher than college algebra? Does your degree involve taking any sort of programming classes? If yes, congratulations, your degree will pass most base requirements for data science. Is it the best? Probably not, unless you're CS or some really heavy math degree where half your classes are taught in Greek letters. Don't come at me with those art history and underwater basket weaving degrees unless you have multiple years experience doing something else.

**SHOULD I DO XYZ BOOTCAMP/MICROMASTERS?**

Do you have experience? No? This ain't gonna help you as much as you think it might. Are you experienced and want to learn more about how data science works? This could be helpful.

**SHOULD I DO XYZ MASTER'S IN DATA SCIENCE PROGRAM?**

Congratulations, doing a Master's is usually a good idea and will help make you more competitive as a candidate. Should you shell out 100K for one when you can pay 10K for one online? Probably not. In all likelihood, you're not gonna get $90K in marginal benefit from the more expensive program. Pick a known school (probably avoid really obscure schools, the name does count for a little) and you'll be fine. Big bonus here if you can sucker your employer into paying for it.

**WILL XYZ CERTIFICATE HELP MY RESUME?**

Does your certificate say ""AWS"" or ""AZURE"" on it? If not, no.

**DO I NEED TO KNOW XYZ MATH TOPIC?**

Yes. Stop asking. Probably learn probability, be familiar with linear algebra, and understand what the hell a partial derivative is. Learn how to test hypotheses. Ultimately you need to know what the heck is going on math-wise in your predictions otherwise the company is going to go bankrupt and it will be all your fault. 

**WHAT IF I'M BAD AT MATH?**

Git gud. Do some studying or something. MIT opencourseware has a bunch of free recorded math classes. If you want to learn some Linear Algebra, Gilbert Strang is your guy. 

**WHAT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES SHOULD I LEARN?**

STOP ASKING THIS QUESTION. I CAN GOOGLE ""HOW TO BE A DATA SCIENTIST"" AND EVERY SINGLE GARBAGE TDS ARTICLE WILL TELL YOU SQL AND PYTHON/R. YOU'RE LUCKY YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE JOY OF SEGMENTATION FAULTS TO RUN A SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION. 

**SHOULD I LEARN PYTHON OR R?**

Both. Python is more widely used and tends to be more general purpose than R. R is better at statistics and data analysis, but is a bit more niche. 
Take your pick to start, but ultimately you're gonna want to learn both you slacker.

**SHOULD I MAKE A PORTFOLIO?**

Yes. And don't put some BS housing price regression, iris classification, or titanic survival project on it either. Next question.

**WHAT SHOULD I DO AS A PROJECT?**

IDK what are you interested in? If you say twitter sentiment stock market prediction go sit in the corner and think about what you just said. Every half brained first year student who can pip install sklearn and do model.fit() has tried unsuccessfully to predict the stock market. The efficient market hypothesis is a thing for a reason. There are literally millions of other free datasets out there you have one of the most powerful search engines at your fingertips to go find them. Pick something you're interested in, find some data, and analyze it. 

**DO I NEED TO BE GOOD WITH PEOPLE?** (courtesy of /u/bikeskata)

Yes! First, when you're applying, no one wants to work with a weirdo. You should be able to have a basic conversation with people, and they shouldn't come away from it thinking you'll follow them home and wear their skin as a suit. Once you get a job, you'll be interacting with colleagues, and you'll need them to care about your analysis. Presumably, there are non-technical people making decisions you'll need to bring in as well. If you can't explain to a moderately intelligent person why they should care about the thing that took you 3 days (and cost $$$ in cloud computing costs), you probably won't have your position for long. You don't need to be the life of the party, but you should be pleasant to be around.

Hi,

My girlfriend is a 22 year old university student passionate about data science, and she just posted my first article on Medium using Machine-Learning (that took her months of research and coding to put together). Her post only has about 500 views, but to her surprise today a reddit user called [**Dean-Hoffman**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dean-Hoffman/) **posted a link to his own data science company where he copy-pasted her article.** He didn't contact her about reposting it, didn't give her proper credit and **ridiculously added a ""Contact Data Scientist"" at the end with his name on it**. On the article, he clearly stated he is the author in multiple locations. This is the ""Data Science"" company that links from the article on his website: [https://www.actionablelabs.com/](https://www.actionablelabs.com/)

Apparently the guy Dean Hoffman is the ""founder"" of the company and refers to himself on the About Us as **""offering the highest commitment to excellence, personal integrity, and business ethics.""**

Update: Hey, this is the girlfriend that wrote the article. First of all, thank you all that made the time to reply, research and help me find answers. It's really appreciated.  So far, this is what we know about this person (or people):

\- This website has been stealing hundreds, if not thousands, of data science projects and articles from legitimate data scientists and writers.

\- The stolen content website in definitely bot-operated as the owner posts dozens of articles a day, completely copy+paste, mainly from Medium, TechCrunch and Towards Data Science.

\- It's confirmed that Dean-Hoffman from the Linkedin that links from his company (Actionable Labs) is a real person and the same Dean-Hoffman that is stealing content and running a data company.

\- If you go on his linkedin, under ""Data Scientist - Pennsylvania Department of General Services"" you will find that he mentions ""Actionable Insights"" (the stolen content website) in one of his experiences. Completely absurd.

UPDATE 2: Medium and TDS unfortunately can't do much for me individually as the authors are the ones who own the rights to the articles. TDS will try to reach out to the owner and ask them to take the posts down. I hope they see that their whole website is being copied, which would most likely infringe their TOS.

Please don't comment anything that contains the words ""copyright"", ""infringement"" or related words on her article as it may trigger keyword algorithms that delete copyrighted articles posted to Medium (and thus could have her article deleted). Thank you!

datascience,tag8l5,My Guide To Writing A Killer Cover Letter,ibsurvivors,1646856194.0,Career,1470,0.97,"Most people think a cover letter is about themselves. This isn’t true.

A cover letter is a marketing tool. Treat it like one and you’ll see it do wonders. Treat it like an autobiography and you’ll wonder why no one gets back to you.

Here’s the cover letter formula that got me my current job:

1. **Analyzing the job description**
2. **Identifying what to include in your cover letter**
3. **Why do you want to work here?**
4. **Writing the cover letter**

**Before we get started:** this is a long post (\~3000 words). If you'd rather get a free PDF copy of it, feel free to [drop your email](https://www.careerfair.io/subscribe) here and I'll be sending it next week. 

**1/ Analyzing the job description**

Always write a cover letter from scratch. It's better to apply for five relevant positions with a complementing cover letter than to apply for fifty positions without any background research.

The best way to do this is to start by analyzing the job description.

A job description is composed of two parts:

1. What you’ll do
2. What the company is looking for (i.e qualifications)

First, focus on the “what you’ll do” portion. The first few bullets are the most important. And we need to make sure that they’re addressed in our cover letter. Start highlighting the ones you have experience carrying out.

https://preview.redd.it/pbakyc28yem81.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2a01ac3f299d4630f4fade5870dce3c1ba9851a9

Next, take a look at the qualifications. Note down the ones you can comfortably meet and ignore any you don’t. We also want to highlight the ‘preferred’ or ‘nice-to-have’ items listed in the job posting if you satisfy those.

*Quick note: Qualifications are always negotiable and should never deter you from applying if you think you’re almost there but missing a few requirements.*

https://preview.redd.it/s1yfj6n9yem81.png?width=3424&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f301bd4619df842700d9ed336f3c9568d36f676c

Make sure to note all these skills you’ve highlighted in the job description down. We’re now ready to move onto our next step.

**2/ Identifying what to include in your cover letter**

Create a table with two columns. In the left column jot down the highlighted skills you identified in the above section. And now in the right column, start writing down how you can match up to the advertised qualifications.

Here’s an example for my latest role. Notice how I try to use as many of the same words as the job description:

https://preview.redd.it/xhalvb7byem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ca7ae0c7eb8671e205148f1b776eb35816452080

For now, just put down the qualifications without any regard for style. Also, you don’t need qualifications for all the requirements. We’re only going to use the top two anyway.

Struggling to come up with qualifications? Try to ask your co-workers or peers about projects they’ve enjoyed working with you on. Keeping a [brag document](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/howtobragatwork) can also be really helpful.

And try to speak the employer’s language. So if a job description mentions “QuickBooks,” don’t just say you’ve used “accounting software”.

**3/ Why do you want to work here?**

You’re a great fit for the role. Now you have to convince them that you want to work there.

Realize that this is just a research based question. If you do enough research, you will find information about the company that you can link back to your own interests and goals.

To help you do research, ask yourself the following questions:

* What is the company’s mission?
* What problem are they trying to solve?
* What’s the product?
* What’s unique about this company compared to its competitors?
* What are some policies or values that the company has that they feature on their homepage?
* Describe any of the organization’s community engagement projects or employee development programs.

A great place to find more info is to look at interviews that their founders or executives have done. Another is the company’s blog.

Once you’ve done your research, list out *why* you find each answer to the above questions appealing. What is it about rockets that appeals to you? Why is a video messaging platform one you can connect with?

And if you’ve been using their product, that enthusiasm will shine through. It’s not mandatory and it’s not even common, but when it does happen, you have a great reason for why you want to work at the company.

*Sidenote: I'm going to release a complete guide on researching companies before the interview soon. If you'd like to read that you can* [*subscribe*](https://www.careerfair.io/subscribe) *here* *and get it when it's released.*

**4/ Writing the cover letter**

We’re going to use the following format for your cover letter:

*(i) Who you are, what you want, and what you believe in.*

*(ii) Transition*

*(iii). Skill & Qualification Match*

*(vi) Why do you want to work there?*

*(v) Conclusion*

***(i) Who you are, what you want, and what you believe in***

Use the first one or two sentences to make some statements about who you are, what you want, and what you believe in. Here are some good examples:

https://preview.redd.it/7tjx90ueyem81.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3a0c8f638b786b22b37a62a32c7f865889352afa

Emphasize your strengths and also ideally mention something specific to the company.

***(ii) Transition***

I like to link the intro in my cover letter to the first skill-qualification match by having a summary statement and attaching it to a generic sentence:

https://preview.redd.it/65imjsigyem81.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=66eccd04c188e9c139f22ea2561cc6ee0ab2aa86

The first sentence summarizes what you will bring to the company. The second helps flow into the experiences you’re about to write about.

Mine would be:

*Over the last 12 months, I’ve helped my company generate over $X in revenue by leading meetings with executive leaders and also built a variety of web applications on the side.*

*And now I’m excited to continue my journey by contributing and growing at Adyen. There are three things that make me the perfect fit for this position:*

Here are some examples that differentiate weak and better summary statements:

https://preview.redd.it/2hssbb2iyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=73b9322c3a07b913065a8cccfaac9d090f44dbb4

Avoid jargon and get specific. Half the words, twice the examples. Ideally with a few numbers sprinkled in.

*Quick Note: The summary statement is also great to add to the top of your Linkedin bio.*

***(ii) Skill & Qualification Match***

Go back to your table matching your qualifications to the requirements. Pick the two most important ones.

We’re going to link your qualifications to a theme. And then use that to transform your boring bullet points into exciting sentences.

Here are eight common interview story themes:

1. Leading People
2. Taking initiative
3. Affinity for challenging work
4. Affinity for different types of work
5. Affinity for specific work
6. Dealing with failure
7. Managing conflict
8. Driven by curiosity

Let's say we ended up with the below table when analyzing a specific job description.

https://preview.redd.it/5zl2adfkyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0530da6495dbd9febf710f9bb61f50ebb8a7f8d5

And let’s take our first qualification:

*Conducted Feature-Mapping and Requirements Gathering sessions with prospective and existing clients to formulate Scope and Backlog. Responsible for managing and creating backlog, writing stories and acceptance criteria for all managed projects.*

Let’s figure out how we can link this to one of the interview story themes:

https://preview.redd.it/mikhhw0myem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5fc1937bd973a6e836e1a1528cd6f18126784b6f

And here's another example:

https://preview.redd.it/otukv2rnyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=49a3b9460a7e449e7cb81dd8a00bf7444d1e3ae7

So what we’ve done here is abstracted some themes from this person’s actual qualifications.

I know this isn't super scientific. More themes than just one work for most qualifications. But the goal is to help you solidify the type of story you want to tell.

And now that you have your theme, you can use it to guide your body paragraphs using this format:

https://preview.redd.it/hkdahc9pyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=34a50751c910936c79ef4ca89e3b529a6062a121

Some more examples:

https://preview.redd.it/cql1thksyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0d0d26fcc0211de29ac7deed3e7821cb812e07b6

***(vi) Why do you want to work there?***

Pick your two most favorite aspects about the company that you already found when doing your research. I like to pick one value driven one and one industry or current topic related. If you use their product, though, that should be first on your list.

If you want to check out some examples for this, you can do that [here](https://careerfairss.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cover_letter_guide/Screenshot+2022-03-07+at+23.30.32.png), [here](https://careerfairss.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cover_letter_guide/Screenshot+2022-03-07+at+23.30.40.png), and [here](https://careerfairss.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cover_letter_guide/Screenshot+2022-03-07+at+23.30.48.png).

Now that you’ve got two reasons, it’s time to craft together a simple paragraph that weaves them together:

*Third, I’ve been following \[COMPANY\] for a couple of months now and I resonate with both the company’s values and its general direction. The \[Insert Value\] really stands out to me because \[Insert Reason\]. I also recently read that \[Insert topical reason\] and this appeals to me because \[Why it appeals to you\].*

Realize that this part is your chance to bring out what you like about the company. And if you can’t really think of anything, maybe you need to rethink why you’re actually applying.

***(vi) Conclusion***

Simply state what you want and why you want it:

*I think you’ll find that my experience is a really good fit for \[COMPANY\] and specifically this position. I’m ready to take my skills to the next level with your team and look forward to hearing back.*

*Thanks,*

*Your name*

**Putting it together**

Combing everything, here’s what my cover letter for my current job looked like:

https://preview.redd.it/i4whem84zem81.png?width=4236&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=baa8e1eeadfa342f716cd295b0b3243a0c53fc68

And voila. You now have all the tools to write a killer cover letter.

They're all about tools, code languages/packages, and algorithms. I think to most aspiring data scientists, that's how they see the profession. You're given a tech stack, some data, and your goal is to apply x tool/algorithm to y data. My argument is this is only going to work at super junior levels, and I believe it's the reason why there's a huge oversupply of junior data scientists but teams still can't find competent seniors.  


As another experiment, just head over to r/dataisbeautiful right now. You'll see a ton of different techs used to generate some decent and some awful visualizations. All of those people were able to access, clean, and plot data. There's no shortage of people who can do that. But what you'll notice if you read that sub, is there's a huge lack of people thinking critically about the data they're working with, and that's the science aspect.

&#x200B;

I feel like every week there's a new topic here on how long until data scientists are obsolete. I don't think data scientists are getting less valuable, but people who can just use tool x to leverage data y are. Why would I hire a senior data scientist to create a dashboard when I can teach an intern tableau and get 95% of the same thing? Whether it's recognizing Simpson's paradox, knowing when to keep/stop digging into research questions, figuring out when gathering more data is necessary, knowing how to communicate findings in ways that make an impact, the science part of data science is by far the most valuable. Some people call them soft skills, but I'm not a huge fan of the term. It's science. Unfortunately these are the toughest skills to learn and also the toughest skills to interview for, so I don't suspect you'll see companies steering away from technical questions in interviews any time soon. But mastering the science aspect of data science is I believe the best way to make yourself extremely valuable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/p7hpd9/the_key_word_in_data_science_is_science_not_data/

You might remember me from the Data Science Cheatsheet I posted a few months ago ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ljftgi/i_created_a_fourpage_data_science_cheatsheet_to/)). The support from that was incredible, and I thought I’d share an update.

Since then, I’ve gone through a dozen interviews, ranging from FANG to startups to MBB, and updated the cheatsheet with topics I’ve seen covered in actual interviews.

Improvements include:

* Added Time Series
* Added Statistics
* Added A/B Testing
* Improved Distribution Section
* Added Multi-class SVM
* Added HMM
* Miscellaneous Section
* And a bunch of other small changes scattered throughout!

These topics, along with the material covered previously, are all condensed in a convenient five-page Data Science Cheatsheet, found [here](https://github.com/aaronwangy/Data-Science-Cheatsheet).

I’ll be heading to a FANG company as a DS after graduation, and I hope this cheatsheet is helpful to those on the job hunt or just looking to brush up on machine learning concepts. Feel free to leave any suggestions and star/save the repo for reference and future updates!

datascience,nue01q,"Data Science and Data Analytics is becoming ultra glorified / romanticized, and I don't think people are really told what they are getting into.",,1623076428.0,Discussion,1064,0.96,"I honestly, don't think people wanting to break into Data Science really know what all it entails. It just sounds good, and sounds like it will make them lots of money.

No one tells people what comes with the job. There are a lot of headaches that come with it, and you have to be a very patient person.

When any person starts out in IT, they learn some psychology. How to manage users and their expectations. You learn what to say and what not to say. You learn how to appear confident and reassuring even if you're getting up to speed in the moment. The good ones do anyway.

Data Science, BI, DA - you have to have those skills multiplied by ten. You have to be better than the rest at managing expectations. You have to learn how to avoid support drains, and be thinking ahead all of the time.

The data science people are the only people I respect as much as the people in Systems. Because other fields, you learn one thing and only one side of it, call yourself an engineer despite knowing one side. Sys Engineers have to know a little about everything and base knowledge in all kinds of things/ They are constantly growing. Data Science folks are similar because they have to know a wide assortment of things, and they have to know all of the tips and tricks at their disposal to get their desired result. Which means they will know Python, multiple types of SQL, Pandas, Jupyter, and so on. They'll pivot in Excel in a pinch if they need to.

But the main reason I respect them is just because of how patient they have to be to want to work in their field for 30+ years.

Our DA left in 2018 and one of my roles was a senior DBA, so they just put her job on top of mine. I learned a lot and I got very good at SQL and streamlining and reducing task turn around for reports and data tasks. But I obviously didn't have the time to dive ultra deep into the rabbit hole, and I didn't want to. Because I knew it wasn't for me.

We were acquired, and I transitioned all of that stuff onto the BI team of the new company. I have so much respect for those people. I am still answering questions and taking one off requests. This morning I was just hit in the face with how much I dislike actually doing he DS/DA side. A Sales Senior Manager needed something with some data. I asked a follow up question. I needed a key piece of info to ensure I did the right thing and didn't have to do re work later. They said they would get it to me later.

They emailed it to me at 7:11am this morning, then messaged me before my shift - ""Hey, I don't see the data task with the blah blah being done. We needed it 6/3."" And I am thinking - then why wait until 6/7 to give me the info. We got the request 6/4, and I asked you on 6/4, then you waited the weekend to get it to me.

And those individuals who just keep coming back telling you the data wasn't what they expected or wanted when it is what they asked for.. I'm so happy to be just a senior sys engineer again working on large scale infra.

It's not for everyone, and I think they need to talk about and teach managing expectations so you don't shoot yourself in the foot. Luckily the BI team of the new company are phenomenal, and now I am out of the game. 

But I am learning more Python at home in my spare time and things like Jupyter so I don't regress skill wise. Python is useful in what I do anyway.

Don't pretend to crowd source over kaggle, your data is old and stale the moment it comes out unless the outbreak has fully ended for a month in your data. If you have a skill you also need the expertise of people IN THE FIELD OF HEALTHCARE. If your best work is overfitting some algorithm to be a kaggle ""grand master"" then please seriously consider studying decision making under risk and uncertainty and refrain from giving advice.

Machine learning is label (or bias) based, take into account that the labels could be wrong that the cleaning operations are wrong.

Hey gang, stand back, it’s rant time. 

Analytics is a new field at my work, and I’m here to pioneer it. I work In corporate at a large medical devices company. 

I’ve had the luxury of an amazing boss, some amazing colleagues, and decent budget. 

But for the love of fucking god... I am so sick of being thrown responsibility or projects because good ol mary in sales watched a video on “gesture recognition”. The ideas are a great, and I have a framework for filtering them, but the fucking pressure, the initiation of projects with 0 data, no aim at data collection, no quality assurance or risk management and the icing on the cake, “we should roll out an MVP in 2 months”. What in gods name is that shit? 

I’m the asshole. I’m always the asshole. 
“Here are my requirements if we wish to complete this project in the given time frame.” 
“So... why can’t you develop it now?”
Bro... for starters, I’m not a full fledged software engineer / deep learning god. 

I ask for resources or a relaxed time, and I get 0.

I never use the terms, because I hate them. They are just the perfect example of how Statistics were developed by people with *terrible* communication skills.

The official definition of a Type I error is: ""The mistaken rejection of an actually true null hypothesis.""

So, you are wrong that you are wrong that your hypothesis is wrong, when, actually, its true that it is not true.

It's, like, the result of a contest on who can make a simple concept as confusing as possible that ended with someone excitedly saying: ""Wait, wait, wait! Don't call it a false positive -- just call it 'Type I'. That'll *really* screw 'em up!""

datascience,lkn4rl,Please STOP asking Data Scientists about Leetcode questions meant for Software Engineers for job interviews,,1613423073.0,Job Search,979,0.91,"I've been working as a Data Scientist long enough to say that asking Leetcode questions for Data Scientists is completely disrespectful. This is both for both product and ML-based data scientists.

Something simple is fine, like hashmaps, two pointers, strings, some light algorithms etc. But graph theories, DFS with trees/dynamic programming has nothing to do with data analytics, ML fundamentals, statistical foundations, and data storytelling competence.

I really don't understand. When you have a wealth of ways to distinguish competent Data Scientists from juniors during interview pipeline (complicated SQL, pandas, data munging, visualization, ML training, building simulation code, etc.), why you'd rather choose questions like ""how many moves do you need to get a Queen chess piece from this position to another on a chessboard"" as a way of measuring how well a Data Scientist would perform analytics or ML training on the job. It really just feels like SWEs making fun of Data Scientists about how poor programmers we are.

Most companies don't pull crap like this, but for those who do, PLEASE STOP. Unless we received a BA or MA in computer science -- which majority if not most of us did not -- we won't be able to solve shit like this unless we cheat and look at answers directly on leetcode or geekforgeeks. And it's infuriating and embarrassing for us to sink to this kind of level to solve questions that aren't meant for us. I get that Data people need to know programming, but WE AREN'T SWEs, and DS is not SWE.

**Edit**: I'm getting a lot of replies saying that I suck at programming and I need to learn SWE fundamentals. I said over and over that I'm not against understanding foundations of SWE (hashmaps, runtime, pointers, optimized solutions vs brute force). These are important. But when you get into highly niched algorithm named after somebody where you need to do some complicated tricks or build a whole system that requires multiple functions, DFS-based dynamic programming, multiple inheritance methods all in 45 minutes that would unnerve even seasoned SWEs out of practice, that's when it becomes totally unreasonable, outside the realm of data science, and just disrespectful to what Data Scientists do on a daily basis. But that's the line I draw, and the overall question is: at what point do interview questions become unjustifiable and unrelated to the position at hand? I've spent years using pandas, scikit-learn, tableau, and complicated SQL for daily data tasks. Why is it that you can't test me on this stuff which occurs on day-to-day basis for majority of data scientists?

**Edit Edit:** Btw, shame on those of you just downvoting everything I'm saying without reading any of it (I can't even locate my own comments anymore). It's immature and completely ridiculous.

datascience,k7iytr,Landing a Senior Data Scientist Job After 6 Months of Unemployment,jakemmman,1607213572.0,Career,964,0.96,"I graduated this year with a masters of statistics. In this article, I will explain the process that ultimately led to my offer for a **Senior Data Scientist ** position for a company in the SF Bay Area. The components of the process that led to my success, in no particular order, were: crafting my resume and LinkedIn, building skills and projects, staying motivated (during the pandemic), decoding the data science interview process, and determining my professional goals.

(**EDIT // Important Note: this is not big N or FAANG, since in the comments people are using top top companies to benchmark my experience**)

## Preface 

As with any statistical inference, a singleton dataset won't yield robustness. I was an unusual applicant to my grad program, and am an unorthodox candidate for DS roles, which is why it took me six months to find a job while my peers all had several offers immediately following graduation (and some months in advance!). I worked for 6 years between my undergrad and masters in the nonprofit world and had many different job titles, as noted in Edit #2 below. Coming back to school was a huge pivot and career shift, and so I am extremely fortunate to have found a firm who recognized the unique strengths I bring to the table; I was also extremely fortunate to interact with this firm at the right time where my unique strength combination was part of their strategic plan. 

**Takeaway:** My experience is not a modal experience, but the tools I used and the lessons I learned may be useful for others. I would have appreciated reading it two years ago, so I'm putting it here in case others relate. Also a friendly reminders to aspiring or current data scientists not to conflate [prior and posterior probabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/posterior-probability.asp).

## Crafting My Resume and LinkedIn

I completely botched my first DS resume. I borrowed a classmate's resume and used it as a template, and tried to copy what they had done. But they had internships, relevant projects, and a better GPA than me, so my version looked... weird, since I didn't have any of those things. Also, I was still expecting people to ""read between the lines"" on my resume instead of being as clear as possible. I started applying and connecting with folks, and what I am shocked by is that **not one person I asked about my resume gave substantial or useful feedback**. The one useful piece of feedback that I received was from my parents, who remarked ""this doesn't seem to really sell you; you're much better in person than on this paper."" While initially, I was resistant to rehauling my resume, I decided to spend a full week almost full time rehauling my resume. This paid off, because I saw a significant uptick in responses and was able to get several first round interviews. The main changes I made:

- Only put what is relevant to the role you are applying for. Even though I had some impressive accomplishments from other projects or roles, I chose the projects or skills that were relevant to data science. 
- Similar to the [first rule of road-side beet sales](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/19/3d/b6/193db68d6c65ce5881edcbd84c1e436c.jpg), I put my best features in the top half of my resume. 
- I used Canva to make a visually appealing resume, and later switched to a LaTeX resume template to make my resume more professional looking. This was a very very good decision, and I got so much positive feedback from recruiters and hiring managers after making that change. 
- I used a LaTeX cover letter template to write cover letters, which made it look very official and professional. It was easier to produce because I could just make a new document in overleaf and change small portions in the letter, since it's mostly common across applications, and once you do enough you have even domain specific and role specific letters ready to go.

**Takeaway:** your image matters a lot. Make sure to craft it carefully, and tailor it for roles that you are really interested in. 

## Building Skills and Projects

My strategy for learning something is spend at least a week or two finding the best resource, then pay whatever it costs (in your budget) and use it 100%. Don't find 16 free cheat sheets and ""shortcuts"". I researched every resource I could find (many thanks to r/datascience, r/machinelearning, and r/cscareersquestions) and I tried out a few, but saw that many only give free temporary access to some subsection of the entire platform, so you can't really explore past the first few questions or modules. However, I saw a reddit post talking about some site called [DataCamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/) where they gave you 7 days for free, but it was full access. I looked through the catalogue and found a lot of what I wanted to learn. I took a week and devoted 8 hours per day to going through the modules. There are some things I would change, but for the most part, it is very well designed, and extremely helpful. I earned somewhere around 20K ""experience"" on the platform, which means I finished \~100-200 exercises from data engineering, modeling, or reviewing OOP in Python. Then at the end of the free trial, they emailed me a 62% coupon for a year's subscription, which brought it down to an insanely reasonable number, like between 100-150 bucks? Easy decision, since I had already mapped my curriculum through the rest of their materials, and they have new courses coming out every 1-2 weeks. 

For textbooks, anything from O'Reily with an animal on the front is probably going to be a good resource. I burned through about a half dozen of those books, taking notes and building the example projects, then moving to DataCamp to do similar projects, then once I felt confident, I would find a dataset from Kaggle or the UCI ML repo and try to carry out the steps, then benchmark my findings with some medium article where someone did the same thing. **Try to keep projects at the center of your learning, then find materials that will add to the project.** This is much more transferrable to a job, and learning to think in this way will help you in interviews. 

I saw an instagram account I follow put out a survey and was getting a lot of responses, but the way they were reporting the data was not able to do full justice to the story they were trying to tell. So I reached out and asked if I could take a look, and they were super excited to have someone with experience weigh in. So I ended up getting a few different spreadsheets, some with categorical and quantitative data and some categorical, while one of the responses was meant for a massively long response (Some users inputted over 1000 words). Do you see where this is going? It's basically a playground where my boss has 0 expectations and all I have to do is improve on autogenerated excel charts. I began cleaning the data in a notebook, then built a set of scripts, then loaded a database, then made a dashboard for the team (using a python flask app), and scheduled cron jobs to extract the data and report results to the ceo/founder of this nonprofit. Every new DataCamp module I completed was one more secret to the puzzle of how to present and improve the data visuals, process, and my code. I got invited to meetings with the other leaders, asked about business decisions, and got to be part of the real life cycle of their mission. 

Now that I had a taste of what that looked like, I reached out to my gym; they keep all of their members data on lifting progress and workout goals in an app, and I was able to give them a fun graphic and report for their members, and they shared on social media and saw an uptick in new memberships! I considered packaging this ""product"" and emailing other gyms, but I got overwhelmed by the pandemic/election and decided to put extra stuff on the back burner and wait for later when I have more skills. 

**Takeaway:** make your learning project driven, and document your entire project, including packaging in several different formats, making a clear write-up, and versions of a verbal explanation that take 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 20 minutes. Then, explain it for a PhD, a CEO, a peer, and a non-technical client (or whatever audiences you want, provided they vary by technical understanding and business investment). Try to carry every project through the finish line. As an example, this post/article is my way of compiling a high-level overview of the job search process--the ""finish line"" of this 6 month project.


## Decoding the Data Science Interview Process

Have you ever been invited to church by your friend, but they didn't explain anything before you got there? You don't know when to raise your hands, or to stand up or sit down, or why the man up front is yelling? That's how I felt for the last 6 months. From when you're supposed to negotiate salary, wtf a ""first year cliff"" is, or what you're allowed to ask and to whom, nobody teaches you this stuff. Why does everything have to be so goddamned awkward and needlessly confusing? I have teaching experience so all of this infuriated me as a very eager learner. 

There are two kinds of people you will encounter: 
- Those who pretend to know the answer, and give you bullshit advice or project onto your experience
- Those who know the answer, but don't know how to explain it, or give equally useless advice like ""just keep applying"". 

Nobody will tell you the truth to your face, or give you meaningful feedback of any kind, and I asked for it *constantly*. They will send you a form email, ghost you, or dodge your questions and judge you for breaking  etiquette **you have no idea about**. 

### My Process

I decided to submit some applications on Linkedin every other day as a benchmark, and took advantage of the ""Easy Apply"" feature to get more applications out. There is a tradeoff between quality and quantity in the applications you send out. Aside from more applications going out, I needed more information, so I decided to use my network to do some decoding.

I went on Facebook, IG, and my LinkedIn and filtered by software, data, CS, analyst etc until I had a list of people to ask questions to. I contacted each of them and asked for a brief phone call to get their advice and to hear about their experience in role R at company C. Here are examples of the questions I asked:

- What are your career goals and how have they changed?
- What are some of the important technologies or libraries to be fluent in as a [their role / your desired role]?
- What helps a candidate stand out when you’re selecting for promotion or advancement?
- What is the culture of [their company] in terms of work / life balance and expectations?
- What does a normal day / week look like?
- What do teams look like and how are projects carried out?
- In risk analytics / Risk dynamics, what are the industry tools?
- For risk analytics, what are differentiators in top analysts?
- What is the culture like?

The final question I always ask is: 

- How do internal referrals work and would you be willing to submit one on my behalf?

I got some first round interviews or conversations with recruiters through this method, but none of the connections panned out, and I only got one technical interview, which was a coding challenge that I answered 5/6 correct, so was not invited to the next round. 

Now that I had exhausted my first round connections, it was time to go to strangers. I went to company pages on LinkedIn and clicked ""people"" and filtered by Data Scientist / Analyst / Data Engineer, then reached out with the following message:

> Subject Line: **[Fellow University Alum]\* wondering about [Company]**
>
>Hey [name], 
>
>My name is [name] and I just finished up at [school] with an [degree] in [major]! I have a background in [sub-filed] and love what I have seen in the job descriptions at [company], and I was wondering if you wouldn't mind connecting and answering some questions I have about the data scientist role and how your experience has been. Thanks so much for your time!
>
>Best, 
>[name]

\* replace ""Fellow University Alum"" with whatever way you can connect with the person based on their profile. Otherwise just say ""Aspiring Data Scientist"" or something humble and eager.

I got several interviews and referrals from strangers this way. 


**Takeaway:** use your network and reach out to make as many connections as possible in order to learn more about what you want or don't want. They may also be happy to refer you to a position.

## Determining My Professional Goals

I interviewed for the following positions: Intern, Research Associate, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Analyst, Product Analyst, Analyst, Consultant, Product Manager, and others. 

I talked to a lot of people and wanted to understand what motivates them, what they are experiencing in their role, and what they hope for in the future. What skills do they have, and are those skills transferrable? It seems to me that coding practices and statistical intuition are very transferrable, and so I wanted a role that would allow me to improve those two things. I want to be able to transfer what I learn in my next role to future roles, and I'm not attached to any particular industry. So it was important for me to distinguish myself from those who love coding, or those who want a 9-5 without much challenge, or those who want to do analyst work but don't want to become leaders. Benchmarking and measuring your goals and feelings against others similar to you but in different roles and spaces is an excellent way to figure out what you want to do, and even what size of company you prefer. 

My set of values pre-job offer:

- Any size company, but prefer a medium team size, and a company without too much bureaucracy. 
- Exposure to ML as well as data-wrangling, without too much emphasis on one vs. the other. 
- If I can mentor or help more junior developers, I would enjoy that.
- Have an enjoyable connection to other employees during the interview process.
- If possible, a company that has a meaningful contribution to society, or positive local impact.
- Being able to bring my ideas and whole self to the job, not just a clock-in clock-out situation. 


**Takeaway:** find out what positions interest you, and try to craft your profile, projects, and skills to fit that role. Don't be afraid to say no to positions if they don't meet your criteria.

## Staying Motivated

The 2020 turbulence shook everything that wasn't securely tied down. I've spent much of my free time on calls with friends and family about navigating the challenges they are facing this year. I had weekends and whole weeks where I didn't do anything except scroll on reddit, tiktok, IG, etc. and felt like shit. I had other weeks where I felt like a superhero, learning things and gaining confidence, getting a website to work, debugging part of a data pipeline, etc. Here are the things that helped me stay on track:

- Getting enough nutrients and listening to my body's caloric needs.
- Stretching and foam-rolling when I feel stiff or uncomfortable sitting all day.
- Lifting weights or going for a walk.
- Taking one or two weeks to stop applying because of rejection fatigue.
- Scheduling phone calls with other people in the same boat to commiserate.
- Watching stand up comedy on youtube to crack up and laugh to break the day's tension.
- Limiting doom scrolling and hyper vigilance (our house was 2 miles from one of the fires, so that was hard).
- Any time I needed a nap, I took that nap. 
- Unfollow anything that isn't encouraging, uplifting, or useful to me in this period of time.

## Giving Back

I was SO LONELY on this journey, and resources on Reddit have helped me massively. As a way to give back to the community, I want to offer the following things for free: 

- A 10-15 minute zoom call to advise you or answer your questions about how to get the Data Science job you're looking for (limited to how many I can fit in next week and who is in dire need). 
- A tailored response to your personal question or situation via email, or advice on how to improve your resume.
- A follow up post on this subreddit answering the top several questions I get.
- Answering as many questions in the comments as I can. I'll reply [""pass""](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-pass-statement-in-python) in some cases, or refer you to resources that were useful to me. 

**Update: Survey now closed. See Edit #5.** 

**Edit #1**: Formatting, added link to [DataCamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/)

**Edit #2:** It's an important note that I worked for 6 years in the nonprofit world before coming back to school. Here's a quote from one of my responses below: 
>""I worked in the nonprofit world and had a lot of different roles and responsibilities, including working abroad in a humanitarian capacity, translating for conferences, logistics and operations, participating in making curriculum for staff and volunteers, casting vision to donors in a fund-development capacity, etc. I wish it were a one-liner 'I worked in software' that would be satisfying or succinct, but it is simply more complicated.""

**Edit #3:** Some people are suggesting that my offers to have a zoom call or offer resume feedback are part of some nefarious ploy to obtain people's information or manipulate them in some way. I'm sorry to hear that. Did you know that there are firms who have been scraping employment data from before the sites had adequate protections in place? I interacted with one such company over the course of my research. It would probably be more efficient for me to make a [LinkedIn Recruiter Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/help/recruiter/answer/a417020/personal-account-vs-recruiter?lang=en#:~:text=LinkedIn%20Recruiter%20is%20a%20talent,of%20active%20and%20passive%20candidates.). Then I could have thousands of emails and LinkedIn profiles all for my nefarious purposes! Muahahahaha! For more stories of recruiting shenanigans, check out r/recruitinghell for best practices. Relevant quote from one of my comments below:
> Hey! I made an edit about this. I had hoped to have some verbal conversations if people were interested, since I have a track record of coaching younger students, teaching, and mentorship. It was the first way I could think to give back to this community aside from writing more posts (which I could certainly do). Is there a method you would suggest that might help that come through more effectively? I definitely don't want to send the wrong message. Thanks!

**Edit #4:** Added Preface section to better contextualize my story.

**Edit #5:** I have closed the survey and will be turning off notifications for this post, following up with the folks who filled out the survey, and writing follow up posts if I get feedback that it will be useful. Thanks to all of you for celebrating with me and helping me make sure this post is as useful for the community as possible!

I got my 1st job after graduating with 2 internships under my belt. I felt I was ready to take on the world.

I started to work for a start up, I moved countries, I was really excited about it but apparently I couldn't present results fast enough or accurate enough.

I always like to assume responsibility, as it is the only way to growth.

On my 1st month I was working with the wrong tables, PMs told me to work with those tables, but those were the wrong tables. I eventually found that I had to request special access to my department's tables... and for some reason those tables were hidden from general view...

2nd and 3rd months I was working with SQL+JSON tables plus all the side tasks. Apparently I did not manage to fully understand the concept of SQL + JSON very well. My numbers were always wrong.

The pandemic hasn't been kind to me (and many others, I know) my focus hasn't been what is used to be, I feel slower, less energetic and less smart.. And the other day I was sent by back to my country, yesterday I broke up with a girl I was seeing... Everything sucks at the moment.

I am not really sure what to do. I like SQL, I like helping business making sense of data, I like doing ad-hocs projects in R or Python. Or at least I thought I did...

I am starting to doubt myself, I feel I am not good enough and that Data might not be for me...

I am sure things will get better, but right now they suck very much.

And of course there are still many things I'm unsure of, completely ignorant of, things I know that I'm doing wrong and things that I don't know that I'm doing wrong - but it feels good to look back and see that I've grown, and that I'm now in the position to help others as others have helped me.

So if you panic or feel helpless when faced with a new, difficult and unfamiliar concept, try to remember that at one point, the things that now come naturally to you also felt that way. And take a second to breathe and realize how far you've come.

datascience,u1ivbw,How I achieved a 6-figure base salary Data Scientist job with 1 year of work experience and a bachelor's degree.,yukobeam,1649714402.0,Job Search,921,0.92,"EDIT: Here is my resume per request. Please don't reverse-engineer this and leak my info somehow, or track this to something connected to me. Trying to do you all a service without it backfiring. [https://ibb.co/zRGqhq0](https://ibb.co/zRGqhq0) I do want to mention that just DOING interviews made me better. My first interviews were a train-wreck. By the end, I felt like an interview expert.

For context, I am 23yo from the US. I have a Math degree from a no-name university, I have taken 0 bootcamps, and I have only taken intro coding courses. I also have some statistics courses under my belt. I have 1 year of relevant work experience and some projects. Let me not undersell myself, but I am far from an expert-level candidate and I have minimal experience.

Here are my tips for getting an interview and job when you're competing with 100s of candidates that all might have more work experience and advanced degrees.

I must first put out that I am a man of faith, so I give God credit. But after that, here are my tips:

**You need a GREAT resume.**

You are competing with advanced degrees and people who probably have much more experience than you. You cannot get away with a bad resume, you simply will be denied immediately. You must do the following:

* Quantify what you did, and how it impacted the business.
* USE KEYWORDS. I don't care if you just touched Keras, put it somewhere on your resume. Some are against this, but use a Skills section at the bottom to include the keywords and then also include them in your highlights. You're looking to at least get an HR interview, your resume will get you there.
* Find a really good-looking template that stands out. Not color, but with formatting.

**Apply Everywhere**

For me, I used LinkedIn exclusively. I did not apply to anything that made me do much more than submit a resume. Its not worth your time. In my experience, take-home coding tests are only worth your time if you've done a series of interviews, it takes 3 hours or less and, the company has shown interest as well.

* Apply even if you're not qualified (not horribly unqualified though). There's flexibility in YOE. I actually got a job interview with somewhere asking for a Masters and 8+ YOE.

**STUDY UP**

* Understand basic statistics. Seriously. Be able to explain every way you'd perform a test and why. What would you do with unbalanced data? Etc.
* Be able to explain a model thoroughly, why would you use it? I was asked to explain loss, variance, bias, what loss function I might use, etc.
* Practice your coding, most of these are in Python
* You must know SQL, preferably advanced-level. I had more SQL coding questions than anything else.

**KNOW YOUR EMPLOYER**

* They WILL ask you case-study questions. You must be able to think outside the box.
* Act super-enthused about their position, even if you are applying elsewhere and its not your #1

**DON'T GIVE UP**

* I submitted easily over 200 applications, received calls on maybe 20 of them, got to the final interviews on 7, was denied on 5, and offered 2.

**MISTAKES I MADE**

* Not remembering my basic statistics, I actually messed up on one interview about ""How would you describe a p-value to a non-technical audience.""
* Not being able to communicate how my projects impacted the company. I have good project experience, but for my first final interview, I had a lot of trouble trying to explain the business impact and how I solved issues. These need to be fresh in your mind.
* Not acting interested. I had at one time, 5 different companies interviewing me and I didn't have much energy to care about each one. This ruined a few of my chances.
* Not studying on the work department. If you are applying to a marketing position, understand a little about marketing... They chose another candidate when I likely would have been chosen had I known a little more background knowledge.

datascience,r5thf9,I just signed an offer on my first Data Science job,BluntButter,1638295959.0,Job Search,883,0.97,"Hey all, 

Long time lurker of this subreddit. I'm about to graduate with a masters of biomedical data science this may. After an internship with amazon this summer and around 40 applications/15 interviews over the course of the school year I got a job offer from a large tech company. 

The study guides from this subreddit have helped me the whole way through and I genuinely wanted to thank the community again. I started out with an undergraduate degree in biology/stats, and have self taught programming based on the advice given from this sub. I started reading it as a junior in my undergrad as I was trying trying transition from biology to analytics. While sometimes there can be discouraging posts, the advice some users give has really made an impact on me and given me insight into the career field that I was able to use when choosing my courses or finding skills to work on in my free time. 

I come from a very underprivileged background of poverty, paid my way though both my degrees alone, and have struggled with imposter syndrome as a woman in CS. I just want others to know that you don't have to be the best, get straight As or land the first interview to be worthy of a good job. I have really struggled this year and felt terrible about 2 out of my 5 interview rounds but still somehow found myself with a substantial offer letter. 

So this is where I am now. I'm excited, don't even feel like it's real yet, but I'm also anxious for the future and want to prove myself even more. 

I'm not sure if it would be of any help, but I wanted to try and give back to the community. If anyone wants to know my interview experience or my experience with applications I'd be happy to talk about it with them in the comments or DMs. I'll try to get back to as many people as possible if there is interest. 

Thank you all for the time you put into your posts and for those who have tried to mentor new people to DS. You really make an impact.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/r5thf9/i_just_signed_an_offer_on_my_first_data_science/
datascience,uryrot,Data Science is Seductive,drake10k,1652828294.0,Meta,877,0.97,"I joined this mid-sized financial industry company (\~500 employees) some time ago as a Dev Manager. One thing lead to another and now I'm a Data Science Manager. 

I am not an educated Data Scientist. No PhD or masters, just a CS degree + 15 years of software development experience, mostly with Python and Java. I always liked analytics and data, and over the years I did a lot of *data sciency* work (e.g: pretty reports with insights, predictions, dashboards, etc...) that management and different stakeholders appreciated a lot. My biggest project, although personal, was a website that would automatically collect covid related data and make predictions on how it will evolve. It was quite a big thing in my country and at one point I had more than 5M views daily. It was entirely a hobby project that went viral, but I learned a lot from it and this is what made me interested in actual data science.

About two years ago, before I joined the company, they started building a Data Science team. They hired a Fortune 500 Data Scientist with a lot of experience under his belt, but not so much management experience. With the help of a more experienced manager, with no relation to Data Science, he had the objective to put together the team and start delivery. In about 6 months the team was ready. It was entirely PhD level. One year later the manager left and so did the team. It's hard for me to say what really happened. Management says they haven't delivered what they were supposed to, while the team was saying the expectations were too high. Probably the truth is somewhere in the middle. As soon as the manager resigned, they asked me directly if I want to build and lead the new team. I was somehow ""famous"" because of the covid website. There was also a big raise involved which convinced me to bypass the *impostor syndrome*. Anyway, I am now leading a new team I put together. 

I had about 50 interviews over the next couple of months. Most of the people I hired were not data scientists per se, but they all knew Python quite well and were **very** detail oriented. Management was somehow surprised on why I'm not hiring PhD level, but they went along with it.

Personally, I hated the fact that most PhDs I've interviewed didn't want to do any data engineering, devops, testing or even reports. I'm not saying that they should be focused on these areas, but they should be able to sometimes do a little bit of them. Especially reports. In my books, as a data scientist you deliver insights extracted from data. Insights are delivered via reports that can take many forms. If you're not capable of reporting the insights you extracted in a way that stakeholders can understand, you are not a data scientist. Not a good one at least...

I started collecting the needs from business and see how they can be solved ""via data science"". They were all over the place. From fraud detection with NLU on e-mails and text recognition over invoices to chatbots and sales predictions. Took me some time to educate them on what low hanging fruits are and to understand what they want without them actually telling me what they want. I mean, most of the stuff they wanted were pure sci-fi level requirements, but in reality what they needed were simple regressions, classifiers and analytics. Some guy wanted to build a chatbot using neural gases, because he saw a cool video about it on youtube.

Less than a month later we went in production with a pretty dashboard that shows some sales metrics and makes predictions on future sales and customer churn. They were all blown away by it and congratulated us for doing it entirely ourselves without asking for any help, especially on the devops side of things. Very important to mention that I had the huge advantage of already understanding how the company works, where the data is and what it means, how the infrastructure is put together and how it can be leveraged. Without this knowledge it would have probably took A LOT longer.

Six months have passed and the team goes quite well. We're making deployments in production every two weeks and management is very happy with our work.

Company has this internship program where grads come in and spend two 3-month long rotations in different teams. After these two rotations some of them get hired as permanent employees. At the beginning of each rotation we have a so called marketplace where each team ""sells"" their work and what a grad can learn from joining the team. They can do front-end, back-end, data engineering, devops, qa, *data science*, etc... They can choose from anything on the software development spectrum. They specify their options in order and then HR decides on where each one goes.

This week was the 3rd time our team was part of the marketplace. And this was the 3rd time ALL grads choose as their first option the data science team. What they don't know is that all previous grads we had in the team decided Data Science is not for them. Their feedback was that there's too much of a hustle to understand the data and that they're not really doing any of the cool AI stuff they've seen on YouTube.

I guess the point I'm trying to make is that data science is very seductive. It seduces management to dream for insights that will make them rich and successful, it seduces grads to think they will build J.A.R.V.I.S. and it seduces some data scientists to think it is ok not to do the ""dirty"" work.

At the end of the day, it's just me that got seduced into thinking that it is ok to share this on reddit after a couple of beers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/uryrot/data_science_is_seductive/

Try volunteering for a political campaign's data team,ryan_770,1615559248.0,Job Search,870,0.98,"I've seen a few posts about how to find volunteer opportunities, or get experience before you are able to land a full-time job.  One avenue I've used to get experience was volunteering for a political campaign's data team.  Campaigns are ALWAYS looking for extra help, and will usually be happy to assign you some easy data cleaning or analysis tasks that you can use to hone your skills.

To get started, I reached out to the data/tech director for a mid-size PAC (after finding them on LinkedIn) and asked if they had any data volunteering opportunities.  If you can't find this person, reach out to anyone in the campaign and ask if they know who to talk to.  Within a few days they had me sign an NDA and I was working on getting insights out of their textbanking data - figuring out which messaging was working best, weeding out phone numbers that volunteers should have added to the opt-out list but didn't, etc.

datascience,iorbjg,Experience/Advice from a 10+ year data scientist,misterpoolittle,1599561718.0,Career,869,0.98,"For context, I was in most people's shoes here so this is why I want to give back some advice and inspiration. There's a bit of misinformation in this subreddit so I'll consolidate my thinking. DM me if you need specific advice

Background:

1. Been working in quant/data science for 10-11 years now. Didn't know where to go because this field didn't exist when I was in school.
2. Self-taught. This is where my imposter syndrome appears but little did anyone know this. Learned SQL through sqlzoo, learned R as a hobby to day-trade (yahoo-finance api, zoo package, etc.), Python through codeschool(?) or codeacademy(?) in 2012 (it was free back then), Math through OCW/torrented whitepapers & textbooks, ML through whitepapers & textbooks (coursera did not exist yet)
3. Interviewed around a lot and got rejected a lot (100+). When I first began, this was not a field, but the interview process & rejections gave me grit and understand what to study. I interviewed for a lot of exciting startups (now public companies) before they were even big. A small hedge fund gave me a chance as a quant trader, and our group got shut down in a year. I got a second chance somewhere else and the company went public (data science was central to their strategy)
4. Data Science is exciting. This field has brought me around the world. Worked at a hedge fund, electricity markets, global consulting, somehow ended up doing A.I work, and now in a strategy role. I don't oversee data scientists anymore, they mostly report to my business function now but previously managed 20+ data scientists.  Worked all over the globe and across many, many states. 

Advice:

1. Study and code everyday. Make it a habit. Blog posts, whitepapers, textbooks. I've lost this habit and I regret it -- getting back into it. You should love learning, otherwise you're in the wrong field.
2. Build up your foundations. Python/R, Probability/Stats/Calculus/LinAlg/DiffEq, Algorithms. This will help you understand a lot . Do take an algorithms & design course. Most problems are solved through a design approach / framework rather than a model.
3. Stay in touch with whats going on. hackernews/datatau/rweekly & understanding  new Data Engineering trends, Tech Engineering Blogs. Example, when I read some company blog about their implementation of spark in 2014, I immediately started playing around with it with my models.
4. Always be humble & prepare to get humbled but remain self-confident and determined. Don't be afraid.
5. Find a subject you like to get started. Loving data & modeling is one thing, but find an area that really interests you. For me, I started with time series (not for the faint of heart). This introduced me to a lot of difficult concepts.
6. Find a product/field. For me it was Energy & Finance. It can be marketing, sales, finance, pure ML, pure optimization work, supply chain, etc. Being a general hobbyist will only get you so far.

Lastly, Data science is not all SQL. It depends on how close you are to the revenue generating side. If you’re making a quarterly report on demand, that isn’t data science. If you’re building growth models to accelerate users on your platform that tie to scale and revenue. SQL will get your dad but still have to come up with model",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/iorbjg/experienceadvice_from_a_10_year_data_scientist/

I recently came across someone on LinkedIn through someone I follow and they claim they are the ""Forbes AI Innovator of the Year"" (if you know, you know). The only reference I find to this is an interview on a YouTube channel of a weird website that is handing out awards like ""AI Innovator of the Year"".

Their twitter, medium and LinkedIn all have 10s of thousands of followers, each effusing praise on how amazing it is that they are making AI accessible. Their videos, tweets, and LinkedIn posts are just some well packaged b-school bullshit with a bunch of buzzwords.

I see many people following them and asking for advice to break into the field and they're just freely handing them away. Most of it is just platitudes like - *believe in yourself, everyone can learn AI, etc.*

I actually searched on forbes for ""AI Innovator of the Year"" and couldn't find any mention of this person. Forbes does give out awards for innovations in AI, but they seem to be for actual products and startups focused on AI (none of which this person is a part of).

On one hand, I want to bust their bullshit and call them out on it fairly publicly. On the other hand, I don't want to stir unnecessary drama on Twitter/LinkedIn, especially because they seem to have fairly senior connections in the industry?

The site has more than 5k resources, for 60+ languages (but mostly Python, R & C++), in 90+ categories, and it will allow you to: 

* Have access to detailed stats about each repository (commits, number of contributors, number of stars, etc.)
* Filter by language, topic, repository type and more to find the repositories that match your needs. 

Hope it helps! Let me know if you have any feedback on the website.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/rh22z9/ive_made_a_search_engine_with_5000_quality_data/
datascience,j1q5w2,Data Scientist = Web Master from the 90s,Jolly_Duck,1601345195.0,Discussion,811,0.97,"This is something I've been thinking for a while and feel needs to be said. The title ""data scientist"" now is what the title ""Web Master"" was back in the 90s. 

For those unfamiliar with a Web Master, this title was given to someone who did graphic design, front and back end web development and SEO - everything related to a website. This has now become several different jobs as it needs to be.  

Data science is going through the same thing. And we're finally starting to see it branch out into various disciplines. So when the often asked question, ""how do I become a data scientist"" comes up, you need to think about (or explore and discover) what part(s) you enjoy.

For me, it's applied data science. I have no interest in developing new algorithms, but love taking what has been developed and applying it to business applications. I frequently consult with machine learning experts and work with them to develop solutions into real world problems.  They work their ML magic and I implement it and deliver it to end users (remember, no one pays you to just do data science for data science sake, there's always a goal).

TLDR;
So in conclusion, data science isn't really a job, it's a job category. Find what interested you in that and that will greatly help you figure out what you need to learn and the path you should take.

Cheers!

Some Redditors asked me in private about the process. The interview process was competitive. One step of the process was a ML task, and the goal was to minimize the error metric. It was basically a single-player Kaggle competition. For most of the candidates, this was the hardest step of the recruitment process. Feature engineering and cross-validation were the two most important skills for the task. I did well due to my Kaggle knowledge, reading popular notebooks, and following ML practitioners on Kaggle/Github. For feature engineering and cross-validation, Kaggle is the best resource by far. Academic books and lectures are so outdated for these topics.

What I see in social media so often is underestimating Kaggle and other data science platforms. Of course in some domains, there are more important things than model accuracy. But in some domains, model accuracy is the ultimate goal. Financial domain goes into this cluster, you have to beat brilliant minds and domain experts, consistently. I've had academic research experience, beating benchmarks is similar to Kaggle competition approach. Of course, explainability, model simplicity, and other parameters are fundamental. I am not denying that. But I believe among Machine Learning professionals, Kaggle is still an underestimated platform, and this needs to be changed.

Edit: I think I was a little bit misunderstood. Kaggle is not just a competition platform. I've learned so many things from discussions, public notebooks. By saying Kaggle is important, I'm not suggesting grinding for the top %3 in the leaderboard. Reading winning solutions, discussions for possible data problems, EDA notebooks also really helps a junior data scientist.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/xgu9wg/kaggle_is_very_very_important/

When I was younger I did computer science at school, worked at Apple at 17 & had work experience at Toshiba Research Europe. Everything was going great until I got my GCSE grades back and realised my coursework was terrible. It wasn’t my fault but rather the teacher had taught us the complete wrong thing to do and only 1 person managed to pass. He was fired but when it came to A Levels I didn’t end up picking computer science. As much as I wanted to, I was anxiety riddled as a teenager and I didn’t believe in myself to do it. I ended up going to university, dropping out because of severe depression & going into bookkeeping. Then lockdown happened. I had so much free time that I ended up doing programming for fun & I got Reddit to try and find fixes to syntax errors when I’m programming but Reddit recommended me this subreddit & data is beautiful and I would check it everyday just because I found it interesting & it was the perfect blend between number crunching and technology - leading me to learn Python & get better with excel.

Fast forward to a few days ago and I manage to get an interview with an amazing employer to work as a Junior Data Analyst. I was really worried because I didn’t know who or what the competition was but I did my best & I mentioned that I followed these pages on Reddit. Turns out they only interviewed one other person and I had the edge as I used Reddit & taught myself in my spare time showing huge enthusiasm!

datascience,lqozmp,My first technical interview experience(22+ interview questions),Professional_Crazy49,1614104086.0,Job Search,785,0.99,"Today, I had a 45mins technical interview with a media based company and I thought I'd share the questions with you all since so many people on this subreddit are looking for jobs. I hope it helps someone! :)

**Background:**

I currently work as a DS and I have 1.5 years of work ex in the data and analytics field. I was initially hired as a DA so my interview was based on SQL which was quite easy (i'm a CS undergrad). I later got promoted to a DS position so I hadn't faced any serious technical DS interviews until today.

**Technical Questions asked:**

1. How would you go about predicting hotel prices for a company like [Booking.com](https://Booking.com)? - I previously worked at a similar company as a business analyst and hence the question. I was able to answer this based on the work I had done there.
2. Let's say you have a categorical column with 500 categories. How would you tackle this? - I answered that we can use Catboost as it uses the catboost target encoder which would help convert the categorical values into numerical values rather than going for one hot encoding. He then mentioned that he wants to use linear regression so I said that we can use target encoding methods like James Stein encoder or Catboost encoder(preferred as it tackles target leakage). Was my answer right or is there some other way because he didn't seem 100% convinced with it?
3. How would you check the weight of each feature in a decision tree? - I said that we can look at the feature importance of each feature. He then asked if a feature importance of 100 means the feature's influence on the target is 100? To which I replied that you can see the SHAP values to understand the influence of a feature on the target but honestly I haven't researched enough on it to comment further.
4. Can I use K Means with categorical data? - You can use one hot encoding to convert categorical data to numerical but using K Means with Euclidian distance on binary columns does not make sense so I would use K Modes rather than K Means for categorical data
5. How do I choose the number of clusters for K Means? - use elbow method or silhouette score and I explained both the methods
6. Let's say I use silhouette analysis on a customer segmentation exercise and get K=30 as optimal number of clusters. I can't show 30 clusters to the business so what do I do now? - I said that generally for customer segmentation we would need business input as well so what is a practical number of segments according to the business? He replied 5-10 so I said that well out of the 5-10 clusters whichever has the highest silhouette score should be chosen. But I don't know if this is the right answer?
7. Difference b/w K Means and K modes? - I just said that for categorical data we use K Modes because finding the mode of a particular category is more accurate and makes more sense rather than converting the category to binary values and using a distance algo like K Means.
8. How would you perform customer segmentation on OTT platforms? - I panicked on this one honestly and said age, gender, nationality and probably genre of shows, do they watch shows completely, how long have they been a member on the OTT platform (Yes ik some of these don't make sense but like i said i PANCIKED)
9. Do you think the above mentioned factors are a good representative of the customer lifetime value? - Uhh no idea what customer life time value means so I just winged this one
10. Can you have more than one independent variable in ARIMA? - I answered yes cause I do vaguely remember coming across this but I am not 100% sure.
11. What is the difference b/w ARIMA and ARIMAX? - ARIMAX is ARIMA but also has exogenous variables which help identify surges like holidays.
12. Would you use ARIMA or Prophet for time series? - I read an article that says a properly tuned SARIMA would outperform Prophet so i answered the same
13. How would you tune ARIMA? - by finding the best parameter values for p,d,q
14. What are p,d,q in ARIMA? - (I forgot what they represent but I tried to answer from whatever I could recall ) p=no. of previous lags to consider, q= i forgot, d = difference(?)
15. What exactly is ""d""? - I said that it represents the seasonality pattern but I now realize that seasonality is in SARIMA and not ARIMA. (ugh)
16. Can you pass non - stationary data to ARIMA? - No, because the assumption of TS is that data is stationary with constant mean and variance as it will assume the same patterns for future values as well
17. How do we check if data is stationary? - By plotting it first but more accurate way is to use Dickey Fuller test to confirm it
18. How do I choose which 10 new hotels to onboard on [Booking.com](https://Booking.com)? - I said that we can look at the number of bookings, location, accessibility( metro, bus), is it near a tourist spot, reviews, stars.
19. What if my model has recommended that all the 10 new hotels that we should onboard should be from the same area X? How do I add a constraint to fix this? - I don't even know what topic this question is from but I said maybe you can modify the cost function by adding a variable which will penalize the cost function based on the number of hotels it suggests that belong to the same area or maybe we can add constraints to the cost function
20. If I add constraints to the cost function then it becomes a non linear optimization problem so how would you use linear programming to solve it? - I had no idea lol
21. What is the difference b/w segmentation and clustering? - I answered that segmentation is a use case of clustering but apparently the interviewer said that clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm while segmentation is a supervised learning algorithm.
22. Have you created a data pipeline before? - Nope

datascience,vceaxx,So many bad masters,AugustPopper,1655242717.0,Education,784,0.89,"In the last few weeks I have been interviewing candidates for a graduate DS role. When you look at the CVs (resumes for my American friends) they look great but once they come in and you start talking to the candidates you realise a number of things…
1. Basic lack of statistical comprehension, for example a candidate today did not understand why you would want to log transform a skewed distribution. In fact they didn’t know that you should often transform poorly distributed data. 
2. Many don’t understand the algorithms they are using, but they like them and think they are ‘interesting’. 
3. Coding skills are poor. Many have just been told on their courses to essentially copy and paste code.
4. Candidates liked to show they have done some deep learning to classify images or done a load of NLP. Great, but you’re applying for a position that is specifically focused on regression. 
5. A number of candidates, at least 70%, couldn’t explain CV, grid search. 
6. Advice - Feature engineering is probably worth looking up before going to an interview.

There were so many other elementary gaps in knowledge, and yet these candidates are doing masters at what are supposed to be some of the best universities in the world. The worst part is a that almost all candidates are scoring highly +80%. To say I was shocked at the level of understanding for students with supposedly high grades is an understatement. These universities, many Russell group (U.K.), are taking students for a ride. 

If you are considering a DS MSc, I think it’s worth pointing out that you can learn a lot more for a lot less money by doing an open masters or courses on udemy, edx etc. Even better find a DS book list and read a books like ‘introduction to statistical learning’. Don’t waste your money, it’s clear many universities have thrown these courses together to make money.

Note. These are just some examples, our top candidates did not do masters in DS. The had masters in other subjects or, in the case of the best candidate, didn’t have a masters but two years experience and some certificates. 

Note2. We were talking through the candidates own work, which they had selected to present. We don’t expect text book answers for for candidates to get all the questions right. Just to demonstrate foundational knowledge that they can build on in the role. The point is most the candidates with DS masters were not competitive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/vceaxx/so_many_bad_masters/

datascience,vzmcc2,Some ideas to improve your LinkedIn profile,dcastm,1657884407.0,Job Search,777,0.97,"Hey everyone,

We're entering difficult economic times, so I thought I could share some of the tactics I've used to get more job opportunities my way by making my LinkedIn (LI) profile stand out.

I'm not an influencer on LI nor I have insider information about its talent search algorithm. This information comes from reading papers about LI's search algorithms, researching LI Recruiter, and a lot trial and error experimenting with my own profile.

Let me begin by setting the stage.

To find candidates, recruiters use a tool called LI Recruiter. It allows them to enter relevant search terms such as ""Data Scientist"" and define filters such as ""has worked at Google"" to look for candidates.

After a query is defined, LI Recruiter uses a ""talent search algorithm"" that works in two stages:

1. It searches the network and defines a set of a few thousand candidates who meet the recruiter's search criteria.
2. Then the candidates are ranked based on how well they fit the search term and how likely they are to respond.

That's it. If your goal is to get more job opportunities your way, then you need to figure out how to improve your chances of appearing in 1 and ranking higher in 2.

Luckily, LI has published research about its talent search algorithm. It's not hard to get an idea of what will help you stand out from the  competition. Based on my research and experience, here are some things that should help your profile stand-out:

1. **Use relevant keywords in your profile.** You won't appear in the results if you don't include terms in your profile that recruiters use when they search for candidates. Review the keywords used in Job descriptions of the positions you're interested in, and make sure you have those in your profile.
2. **Reply to recruiters.** People often don't reply to recruiters when they're not interested in the job  opportunity. But the algorithm prioritizes those who are likely to  respond over those who are not. Respond to recruiters, even if it's just  to say no!
3. **Grow your network.** The lightweight version of LI  Recruiter only lets recruiters reach out to candidates up to their  3rd-degree network. Having few connections decreases your chances of  getting contacted.
4. **Gain influence.** You rank higher if you create  engaging content, have many visitors to your profile, or receive  endorsements and recommendations. As a general rule, try to write useful  content periodically and ask for recommendations from relevant  connections.
5. **Make relevant connections.** Wanna work at X? Make meaningful connections from X and interact with the brand. When recruiters from X are looking for candidates, you will rank higher.
6. **Use a photo.** This is based on my personal experience. A photo, especially a ""good"" one, increases the likelihood that recruiters will contact you.

If you have any questions, shoot me a message. And just for reference, here's [my profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylanjcastillo/).

But when I wrote that my first job as a Data Scientist was making $150k a year and that we can easily make $200k with upgraded skills, experience and right negotiation, people here laughed at me -- said that I was trolling and that kind of salary was insane. I told them this is the average in the Bay Area, but they said that even seniors don't make this kind of salary.

Well 2 years later, I have just secured a $200k salary, $170k in base and $30 in yearly bonus (not including RSU). This is for a Data Scientist in ML role at a company in SF (not well known, but a stable company). I eventually settled for another company with far less salary but far better stock potential. But still.

Given that I proved my initial point, I want to say few additional points of affirmation.

1. Don't undersell yourself. Know your value and worth and stick to it with confidence even in this terrible economy.
2. If you can impress the hiring manager and the senior management during interviews, they're more than happy to work with your professed worth (if not in salary, then in bonus, stocks, etc.). Otherwise, they will lowball you. This requires a refined skill in both communication and technical chops
3. Know how to play the political game during interview cycle. Master the negotiation tactics. Know how to bluff. Too many tech folks don't like to do this and think that they can keep their heads down and work hard, and their accomplishments will be naturally rewarded by some supernatural force. That's rarely the case. Data and Software folks are not immune to necessities of nuanced and skillful communication.

BTW, I don't have FANG-level experience. My first company 2 years ago was a mid-sized startup most people haven't heard of.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mimpre/against_the_negativity_here_i_just_received_my/
datascience,ldvl72,Is anybody else here trying to actively push back against the data science hype?,Least_Curious_Crab,1612609214.0,Career,756,0.96,"So I'd expected the hype to die off by now, but if anything it's getting worse. Are there any groups out there actively pushing back against the ridiculous hype?

I've worked as a data scientist for 5+ years now, and have recently been looking for a new position. I'm honestly shocked at how some of the interviewers seem to view a data science job as little more than an extended Kaggle competition.

A few days ago, during an interview, I was told ""We want to build a neural network"" - I've started really pushing back in interviews. My response was along the lines: you don't need a neural network, Jesus you don't have any infrastructure and your data is beyond shite (all said politely in a non-condescending way, just paraphrasing here!).

I went on to talk about the value they CAN get out of ML and how we could build up to NN. I laid out a road map: Let's identify what problems your business is trying to solve (hint might not even need ML), eventually scope and translate those business problems into ML projects, start identifying ways in which we can improve your data quality, start building up some infrastructure, and for the love of god start automating processes because clearly I will not be processing all your data by hand. Update: Some people seem to think I did this in a rude way: guys I was professional at all times. I'm paraphrasing with a little dramatic flair - don't take it verbatim.

To my surprise, people gloss over at this point. They really were not interested in hearing about how one would go about project managing large data science problems. Or hearing about my experience in DS project management. They just wanted to hear buss words and know whether I knew particular syntax. They were even more baffled when I told them I have to look up half the syntax, because I automate most of the low-level stuff - as I'm sure most of us do. There seems to be such a disconnect here. It just baffles me. Employers seem to have quite a warped view of day-to-day life as a data scientist.

So is anybody else here trying to push back against the data science hype at work etc? If so, how? And if many of us are doing this then why is the hype not dialling back? Why have companies not matured.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ldvl72/is_anybody_else_here_trying_to_actively_push_back/

datascience,jvwgq3,A little advice after 15 years in this field as an industry practitioner and academic.,leonoel,1605631921.0,Career,716,0.97,"I noticed an inflow of people disappointed that the field is not what they thought it would be employment wise.

Correct me if I'm wrong but my overall feeling is that you are not reaping the rewards your masters/bootcamp/online course promised. You are not turning down people left and right asking for your services. And thus, you feel like the field is not what you wanted.

A bit of my background I started doing ""data science"" back in 2005, I have a Masters and a PhD on applied Machine Learning. I've done consulting in AI for NTT Japan (largest IT company in the country), done 2 postdocs in top 20 Universities, both of them on applied AI to Science. Consulting to the largest companies in LatAm, and currently on charge of 10+ ML/DataScience experts as ML Director as one of the Largest Banks in LatAm by assets.

* 1st Advice. If you are in it for the money, better invest wisely.

**If you have no experience**. Don't spend 400 usd in 400 little Udemy classes, or a Datacamp subscription, etc. Spend big and go to a big name school to do a Masters, there are plenty of funding options. Believe me, even if you learn the same thing, the fact that your certification/course says MIT instead of DataCamp is my only pointer if you don't have field experience at all. I say it again, this is **IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE.**

* 2nd Advice. Get all the experience you can, even if it's pro bono!

There is nothing like working with real datasets, I couldn't care less if you did all the tutorials on tensorflow or Sklearn using MNIST or Fashion MNIST, guess what, so did the other 40 applicants. But if you were privy to any datasets that few people can access, then I can see some value if your business understanding and capability of deploying ML techniques with data that no one else has seen before.

Sound hard? no, is extremely easy, the fact that there is a shortage of talent is no illusion. Go to a local University and look for researchers that might need to use ML in something, and offer to do that analysis, or only cleaning the data for free. That gives you both experience and opens doors for future employment.

The most interesting datasets I've seen have been in projects that I did for free or very little money.

* 3rd Advice. Learn the business and build yourself a niche.

Again, there is a need for DS and ML practitioners, that is very real, I have 3 open positions right now. But guess what? I won't hire anyone with no Finance or related experience. I need people capable of understanding business terms, and are capable of reading a Cash Flow and an Income Statement. Few applicants really know how to do it or have any interest in how to do it.

I have friend in the oil industry and is the same story all over again, people just want access to a dataset with no interest in learning about oil or extracting processes. 

&#x200B;

Note: Notice that all this advice is to give you all that extras and plus that you will need to get hired, doing a bootcamp or a course is not good enough anymore, you need to differentiate yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/jvwgq3/a_little_advice_after_15_years_in_this_field_as/

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


Edit: Seems like this was removed from r/learnprogramming. Trying to direct all the PMs to come here

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


First, I want to thank the entire reddit community because without this place I wouldn’t have went down the rabbit hole that is self-learning, job searching, and negotiation. 

&nbsp;


Second, just to list out my background so people know where I started and how I got here: I graduated in 2013 with a bachelor’s in civil engineering (useless in this case) and again in 2015 with a master’s in operations research (much more useful, namewise at least) both from the same top school. The name of the school and the operations research degree opened up quite a few doors in the beginning of my (2-year) career, and definitely was a factor in getting an interview, but had nothing to do directly with what was needed for the Data Science job. This is because that offer was contingent on a programming skillset and specific data science problem-solving abilities, of which I had none right after graduation.

&nbsp;

The most useful advice to keep in mind: keep trying, keep learning, don’t be afraid to switch jobs when you’re bored or it’s not what you want, continuously look for new opportunities, and always negotiate. I went from a 47k job where I lasted only 4 months, to a 65k job where I lasted just under a year, to a 90k job where I stayed 10 months, to my new job at 115k. All in under 2 and a half years. Strap yourself in, this will be long!


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Step 1:**


Get your first real job out of college, realize how much you loathe it, feel entitled because they’re not paying you for your amazing theoretical prowess that isn’t really useful, realize that you were meant to do much more cool shit, and convince yourself that you need a higher paying job.


My first job out of grad school lasted 4 months. It was an analyst title, which I thought was awesome because I had no idea what analysts do, but it was mostly bitchwork and data entry. The one upside was that my boss mentioned a pivot table once, and I googled it, so I finally learned what it was. But I still figured I was too smart for this shit so I looked for other jobs because I needed something to challenge me.


Congrats, you now have the drive to get your ass to a better role!


&nbsp;


**Step 2:**


I got into the adtech industry after my 4-month stint, they liked me because of that pivot table thing I learned to do /s. This is where the data science itch began, but I knew I wouldn’t be satisfied in the long run. As pompous as it is to keep saying I was too smart for this shit, I was. I just needed the tools to show that.


The amount of data that lives in the industry is insane, and it’s always good to mention how much data you’ve worked with. This place is where you earn your SQL, Excel, and Tableau medals. You edit some dashboards, you pivot and slice data, you don’t necessarily write your own complex queries from scratch but you know how they look like and know what joins do.


By no means was I going to do any advanced stuff at work so I needed to start doing it on my own if I wanted to grow. In my time at this job (after work but also during work. Use your down time wisely!), I took MIT’s Intro to Comp Sci with Python, Edx’s Analytics Edge, and Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning. This set up the foundation but since they were all intro courses, I couldn’t apply the knowledge. There were still a bunch of missing pieces.


But! At least I got started. Towards the end of my time there I found rmotr.com through reddit. I finished the advanced python programming course, which was incredibly difficult for me at the time because of the knowledge density and intensity. I highly recommend it if you want to learn more advanced python methodologies and applications, and also if you’re leaning towards the development side.


&nbsp;


**Step 3:**


I left my last company of a few thousand people, where everything was essentially fully established, and moved to a smaller company of 100ish people. There was more opportunity to build and own projects here, and it’s where I earned my dev, analytics, and machine learning medals. This is where classes will continue to aid in your learning, but where google and stackoverflow will help you actually BUILD cool shit. You will have thousands of questions the classes won’t be able to answer, so your searching skills will greatly improve in this time.


During my time here I completed Coursera UMichigan’s Intro to Data Science with Python. I completed it relatively quickly and from what I recall, it wasn’t too challenging. 


After that course, I stumbled on Udemy and completed Jose Portilla’s Python for Data Science and Machine Learning bootcamp, which was a turning point from knowledge to application. This class is a must. It’s how I learned to neatly organize my data frames, manipulate them very easily, and, thanks to google and stackoverflow, how to get all that data into csv and excel sheets so I can send them to people. It doesn’t sound like much, but data organization and manipulation was the #1 worthwhile skill I learned. It’s also where I learned to implement all machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn, and a bit of deep learning. There wasn’t much theory behind it, which was perfectly fine, because I was going for 100% application.


This is also where I took advantage of the training reimbursement at work- I kept buying courses and it was free! During this time I also completed Stanford’s Statistical Learning course on their Lagunita platform (good for knowledge base), the first three courses of Andrew Ng’s Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (it was a breeze because it was in python and I had a deep understanding of dataframes by this time, also very good for knowledge base and algorithm implementation from scratch), and another Udemy class from Jose Salvatierra called the Complete PostgreSQL and Python Developer Course- also a game changer. It was the first course I had on clean python code for software development. The way he thinks is outstanding and I highly recommend it.


&nbsp;


**Step 4: Resume Building and Linkedin**


There are articles out there that can explain this a lot better than I can, but here were my steps to have my resume and Linkedin Ready:


*Resume*


1.	Kept the resume to one page, had it look more modern, sleek, and fresh (even had dark grey and blue colors) 

2.	Under my name, listed my email, number, github, and linkedin across the entire width of the page


3.	Recent work experience on top. Descriptions included what technology I used (python, impala, etc.) to do something (built multiple scrapers, python notebooks, automated reporting, etc.) and the effect (saved hours of manual work for account managers, increased revenue day over day by X, etc). This can be easily remembered by saying I used X to do Y with the Z results.


Note: Not all of my descriptions had results. My last listed job on my resume only had the support work I did- I supported accounts totaling X revenue monthly, partook in meetings with clients, etc. Not every task has a quantifiable outcome but it’s nice to throw some numbers in there when you can.


4.	I read in some places that no one would care about this, but I did it anyway, and listed all courses and bootcamps I had finished by that time, which was around 8. While I had some projects I had done at work I could speak to, I wanted them to know that I was really dedicated to learning everything I could about the field. And it worked!

5.	Below that was my education- both degrees listed without GPAs


6.	And lastly, active interests. Maybe old-school corporations don’t care for things like this, but for start-uppy tech companies that are in a growth stage, I figured they’d like to see my what I do on the side. I’ve been competitively dancing for almost a decade and weightlifting for more than that, so if being a dancing weightlifting engineering-background guy makes me seem more unique, I’m going for it. Whatever makes you stick out!

*Linkedin*

1.	Professional-looking photo. Doesn’t have to be professional, just professional-looking.

2.	Fill out everything LinkedIn asks you to fill out so you can be an all-star and appear in more searches. The summary should include a shitload of keywords that relate to what you’ve done and what you want to do. Automation, analytics, machine learning, python, SQL, noSQL, MS-SQL, throw all that shit in there.


3.	I only filled out the description for my most recent job because that’s where I actually did cool shit. I put a lot more detail here in LinkedIn than I did on my resume. Then I listed the 3-4 jobs I had before that, no description

4.	Put all my certifications from the courses I took with links


5.	Put my education, obvs

6.	The rest…eh. Doesn’t really matter.


&nbsp;


**Step 5: Job Search**


So you have your nice and shiny resume ready, and your LinkedIn set to go. This is where the entirety of your hard work will be rewarded. How badly do you want this job?


I stopped using indeed, monster, etc. a long while ago. 


The single tool I used was and still is Glassdoor. Download a PDF copy of your resume to your phone or a cloud drive, search on Glassdoor ON THE DAILY. Keep saved searches ready to go- “junior data scientist”, “data scientist”, “senior analytics”, “senior data analyst”, “junior machine learning”, “entry data science”, and so on. When you’re on the bus or laundromat or in bed late at night and can’t sleep, look for openings. Filter by the rating you’re willing to take on and apply like mad. I got dozens of applications done just from waiting at the laundromat. All the calls I had after were 100% from Glassdoor applications.


&nbsp;


**Step 6: The initial call**


I’ve had 3 total initial calls from the probably 50 or so applications I sent over the summer (very few openings that didn’t require 5+ years of java and machine learning product dev etc. etc. and largely distributed blah blah where I live).


Here were most of the things I was asked:


•	What tools I used at work 


•	How have I made processes more efficient at work


•	Anything I’ve automated 


•	Largest amount of data I worked with and what was the project and result


•	Why the shift from the current job


•	How much I know about their company and how I’d describe the company so someone else (do your research!)


I had 100% success on my initial calls. Each time mentioned some sort of python, automated scripts (simply by using windows task scheduler and batch file- thanks to google search!), and a data manipulation project (highest I’ve had is a few million rows), and I was good to go.


&nbsp;


**Step 7: The data exercise**


From those 3 initial calls, I had 2 exercises sent via email and one via Codility.


The first exercise was SQL and visualization heavy. I was given a SQLite database to work from and had to alter tables to feed into other tables to aggregate other metrics and so on. Once that was done, I had to use the resulting tables to do some visualizations and inference.


Did I know how to do most of what they asked? Hell no. I had google and stackoverflow open for every little detail I didn’t know how to do off the top of my head. The entire thing took about 20-25 hours spread across the week and even when I submitted it didn’t feel complete. I couldn’t afford not to put all my free time into this exercise.


The end result: the hiring manager and team was impressed with the code, but they didn’t vibe with the presentation style of my jupyter notebook and it was very apparent that I lacked the domain knowledge required (this was for a health tech company, and I have no health anything experience). It actually prompted them to re-post with an altered job description requiring domain knowledge. Woo? Regardless, this served as a huge source of validation for me- these senior level members thought my code was good. 


The second exercise was from the company I ultimately accepted. It was 3-4 hours in total to assess business intelligence skills (SQL and visualization). They liked it and I moved on to the in-person, which I’ll go into in the next step.


The last exercise was codility- and while my code “worked”, there was likely some test cases I didn’t account for. Either that or the company got irritated when I said I received an offer and if they could speed up the process. They didn’t follow through.


&nbsp;


**Step 8: The in-person interview**


So you got to this stage! Congrats!


And you’ll be interviewing with 3 VPs, 2 C-level execs, and 2 data scientists. Jesus fuck, you’ve never met this many executives in your whole life.


No need to freak out. This simply validates your hard work. You’ll be meeting with very important people for a very important job, and they think you might be good at it. 


Even if I hadn’t made it past this, I tasted victory.


I did something that may not be recommended by most people: I didn’t prepare for questions they’d ask me, but rather prepared for all the questions I’d ask them. This did two things: I didn’t obsess about what they’d ask me so I was relaxed, and it gave me a lot of chances to show I knew my shit when I asked them a bunch of stuff. Besides, for a data science job, I figured they’d ask questions about how I’d solve some problems they currently have, as opposed to some common questions. And that’s exactly what they did. Not something you can really prepare for the night before, since it’s a way of thinking you’d have to grasp through all the classes and projects and problems you solved at your current job.


IMPORTANT NOTE: I am not advocating ignoring prepping for questions. I did about 30-35 interviews, phone and in person, before my current job so I had a lot of learning experience. I already had a more natural-feeling response for most questions. And if you really were into your projects at your current job, you’ll know what you did inside out, so it’s easier to talk about it on the spot. But by all means, if you don’t have much interview experience, prepare and practice!


Here are my notes from after the interviews, including what was asked and how I answered, and what I asked:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**VP of Data Science**

&nbsp;

•	*Notice any hiccup in your exercise?* I debated with him on the accuracy of a single statement in the exercise, assuring him that since I used a Hadoop-based query engine and they used AWS, my method worked every time I used it. I never checked whether he or I was right because afterwards I started thinking he was right and didn’t want to feel like an idiot. But we moved on rather quickly.

&nbsp;

•	*How would you implement typo detection?* I gave a convoluted response but put simply, some distance index between words. As in, how many changes would it take to get to the word we may want. He liked the answer because it’s what he was thinking too.

&nbsp;

•	*How’s your style of explaining things to people?* Very logical step-by-step process with the goal of weaning people off needing me. I’d explain it to them completely, then next time leave a few steps missing and ask if they’d remember, then eventually just give them a step or two.

&nbsp;

•	*What’s something you want to be better at?* Being more personable when explaining technical terms to non-tech people

&nbsp;

Then I went crazy with a ton of questions about what projects they’re working on, what’s the first thing I’d be working on, the challenges they have currently, how do they interact with the sales team, and so on.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**VP Tech**

&nbsp;

•	*So, data! Tell me about it.* I told him that I love it, I’m excited by it, and I wana get better at it.

&nbsp;

•	*What as a process you made more efficient at work.* Created an automated process using a batch file to run python script via task scheduler. It scrapes an internal web tool and creates reporting that otherwise doesn’t exist, which saves hours for the account managers weekly.

&nbsp;

•	*So you aimed towards a process that would essentially take something that’s not working too well, fix it, and productionalize it?* Why yes, yes indeed.

&nbsp;

•	*So that kind of sounds like a software development mentality.* Absolutely, and eventually after I have a lot of exposure to the research side of data science I’d like to get more into a machine learning engineering role to build everything out.

&nbsp;

•	*Cool man!*

&nbsp;

He probably liked that I wasn’t purely analytics, but also built tools to solve problems not related to data science.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**COO, President** 


•	*What are areas do you think you need development in?* Being more on the business side of things, as I tend to like delving deep into my code to make things work I sometimes get delayed info of the overall business health.

&nbsp;

•	*Do you have any entrepreneurial experience?* I said nope, to which he responded with “Nothing? Not even selling lemonade?”. Then it jogged my memory of when I tried to sell yugioh and pokemon cards at the pool when I was young, with my binder of sheets with prices too high so no one would buy. He had a laugh and said it was a good answer because the simple experience in learning the prices were too high was a lesson.

&nbsp;

•	*What are you looking for?* Something challenging, where I won’t be just a SQL monkey (this term was thrown around by a lot of the team, so I kept repeating it and made references to who mentioned it to show that I’m paying attention), where there will be big issues to solve across the company, and a place where I’d be doing something meaningful. In this case, it was helping local businesses thrive, and I’m all for that. I’m coming from an adtech background, so the emphasis was very clear on the “finding meaning” part.

&nbsp;

•	*If that's the case, why this company?* I liked that they were VERY fast with their interview process. I told him that and that it shows a lot about the company and how much they care to get things done. 

&nbsp;

•	*What was your proudest moment?* Told him about the first time I built a tool that helped the business, which was at my current company. The year or so of effort learning python and databases and manipulating dataframes led to a really cool scraping project that now seems rather novice, but I couldn’t contain my excitement when I accomplished it.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**Data Scientists**


Sit and chat. I asked them questions about how they like it there, what projects they worked on, etc. Very laid back.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**VP Marketing (first form)**


This was the one guy who really grilled me with problem solving questions. 

&nbsp;

•	*Why did google decide to build out their own browser?* This is where my background in adtech helped. I listed almost everything I could about user data, selling to advertisers, tracking users, etc. He thought those were good answers, but it wasn’t what he was looking for. He asked me the next leading question.

&nbsp;

•	*What was so good about chrome compared to IE?* I stumbled on this since I never could really compare it fully to internet explorer since I never used IE, I just knew people said it sucked. With some guidance I answered correctly: faster load times.

&nbsp;

•	*And what does that mean?* I took a few seconds of thought and answered correctly, that google wants their search pages to load faster.

&nbsp;

From there, he pulled some stats about google CPC and rates from another country and asked me how much would google make in capturing a certain percent of the internet explorer user market. My process was correct, but the multiplication was off in the end. A bit embarrassing, but at least I owned it and made some jokes about division by hand. Got the correct answer after.


That concluded the first in-person interview. Got called for another in-person and I was shitting myself because I thought maybe they didn’t get enough information. I was much more nervous for this one, but once the interviews started I was calm and confident.

&nbsp;

**CMO** 

&nbsp;

•	*What are some of areas that you need development in?* Same as I said before- business side things.

&nbsp;

•	*Why the short tenure in your old jobs (4 months, 12 months, 9 months)?* THIS is where you have to show yourself as the ever-growing, constant-learning, autodidact with insatiable appetite to learn. I told him I learn on my own outside of work, I apply that knowledge to build cool shit, and that I outgrow my positions very quickly so I needed something more challenging. I backed it up with the projects I completed.

&nbsp;

•	*What'll be the biggest challenge you'll face here?* Data Science team structure- sprints, prioritizing the right projects, etc. Haven’t experienced it before so I’d have to learn how to operate within that structure.

&nbsp;

•	*What would your current boss say about you?* I explained that I have sort of two bosses, one tech and one nontech. The tech one would say I can take an idea and run with it to build a tool. The nontech would say I’m very helpful and available asap when he needs me.

&nbsp;

•	*What would they say you need improvement on?* Nontech boss- business side of things. Tech boss- get more into the details of adtech, like which scripts are executed on the page, how it relates to different servers, etc.

&nbsp;

•	*What would your last boss say about you?* Always learning on the job

&nbsp;

•	*What's one example of when you thought outside the box?* Gave example of how the data engineering team was backed up and couldn’t ingest some third party data, so I used python to ingest the data 6-8 weeks before they could do it. I also explained that while the process was essentially the same (extract, transform, load) I thought outside the box by not relying on the team assigned with the task and figured out my own way to do it. He thought that was an excellent example.

&nbsp;

•	*What was your proudest moment?* Same answer as before

&nbsp;

•	*Why the move?* Current company is pivoting, has been for 8 months but not much to show for it, a lot of senior leadership is exiting, not confident in the direction it’s taking, so figured this would be a great time to make a change.

&nbsp;

•	*How would you describe your old bosses?* Last job- was first a coworker that was promoted to my boss. She was very kind, figuring out how to manage, but never lost sight of being compassionate and fighting for her team. Wonderful overall. Current job- nontech boss is very hands off since he doesn’t know the details of what I do, but gives good overall ideas. With tech boss, we work together constantly on data tasks or ideas for new tools to build. Very logical and unemotional at work, similar to me.

&nbsp;

After, I asked about what success looks like in the role and what were the biggest challenges facing his department.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**VP Marketing (final form)**


Here he was again! Back with more questions to grill me. I really liked the guy because he did his due diligence, and it was fun because the questions made my brain’s gears go overdrive.

&nbsp;

•	*How would you go about seeing if users ordering from more than one location is profitable?* I responded with a very convoluted explanation for A/B test, which he said was good, then asked how to do it without the ability to do A/B test using data we already have. Was able to eventually tell him something along the lines of a time series analysis involving control groups.

&nbsp;

•	*Walk me through how you'll implement A/B test.* Told him the basics, but that I haven’t done it in practice. Couldn’t answer his question about how long it should run for so I told him straight up, and he was okay with it.

&nbsp;

•	*How would you go about determining the optimal number of recommendations to show on the app for each geographical type?* Basic group-bys by geo and success rate for each number of recommendations shown.

&nbsp;

•	*What is logistic regression?* At this point I had just finished one of Andrew Ng’s deep learning course, where you code a logistic regression from scratch, so I did a little showboating here with how much I knew =D

&nbsp;

•	*Take me through the process of how you got into machine learning.* I told him basically what I’ve described here- that I felt useless after my master’s, needed to not be left behind in the machine learning revolution, went crazy from day one and here I am.

&nbsp;

I asked him:


•	What are the projects I'll work on in the first month?


•	You worked at other huge and established companies, so why here and what makes you come back everyday?


And! I give you the absolute best question to ask:


•	“You’ve had the most opportunity to get to know me and my skillset. I’d like to know if you had any reservations about my qualifications as a candidate so we can discuss and take care of any concerns.”


Boom! And just like that, I knew how impressed he was and that the only reservation was my short experience, but that I more than made up for it with my passion and drive. He almost didn’t want to say my lack of experience was a concern and looked very hesitant, I guess in fear of having me being like “peace!”


And that was that!


&nbsp;


**Step 9: Wait forever and get paranoid**


Title says it all. It’s hard to wait and wait especially when you felt like you did really well, and especially when the interviewing process took 3 weeks but the decision process takes another 3 weeks. My advice is simply keep applying to other places, don’t take your foot off the pedal, and continue learning/building things. I managed to finish another 2 courses from the time of the first interview to the offer, and even built my own small personal website. Don’t let up!


&nbsp;


**Step 10: Negotiate**


I’ll leave it to you to gather more advice on negotiating and how to go about it, but my general advice is to always negotiate. Whether the market value is higher than the offer (I’m not a fan of this explanation but I’ve never had to use it), or you suddenly feel that the responsibilities are worth more or, as in my case, you realize they don’t offer benefits you thought would be offered, then NEGOTIATE. It can be by phone or email, just do it. It’s uncomfortable, you’ll question your decision every second of the day for what seems like forever, you think they’ll rescind the offer and get someone cheaper. Just relax. It’s business. It’s part of showing your skills by not leaving money on the table. With a role as specialized as this where there is a lot of demand, you have the upper hand if you’ve already proved yourself. I got a nice bump at my current job and at the new data science job by asking for more. I’ll leave you this fantastic link that helped with a changing mindset:


http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

And that’s a wrap! A quick summary of the most important lessons I learned in this journey:


-	You don’t have to get an expensive Data Science degree or go to an expensive bootcamp. Everything is literally available for free somewhere online, and more structured resources are available at very low cost (Udemy and their $10 specials!)


-	Glassdoor is the most important app in this process. Download it, keep a fresh copy of your resume on your phone, and send out apps during your commute, at the laundromat, while in bed on a lazy Saturday, etc. It’s almost effortless


-	Absorb everything you can. A lot of it won’t stick, but a lot of it will.


-	Learning demands consistency. 10 hours of study spread across 2 weeks is much better than 10 hours you did that one weekend 2 weeks ago.


-	USE what you learn somehow- if you picked up python, google how to scrape the web, or how to automate sending files via email, or how to connect to a certain database. Make a project out of it, even a mini-project that you can speak about later. Google will show you the way! Optimizing processes is sexy and it was the most frequently asked question in this job search. 


-	In case you couldn’t tell, google and stackoverflow were lifesavers


-	Talk is cheap. A lot of people I know talk about taking classes and how excited they are. A year later they’re in the same place. Learn it, use it, and continue learning. Spend less time talking about how you’re gonna do something and work towards getting it done.


-	You’ll stumble through a lot of material- and that’s okay. Not everything is connected in the beginning, and a lot of it will feel like wasted effort. Keep going! You’ll reach the “aha!” moment when everything clicks and you “get it”. It might take a year and a half, but think about what would have happened if you started a year and a half ago?


-	Adding to the last point, it’s hard to know where to start and where to go. I’ll summarize a cheap quick start guide for data science below if you’re lost!


-	Get ready to make sacrifices. On average it was 3-4 hours daily, everyday, before or after work, and sometimes 6 hours on each of the weekend days. And this isn’t counting the coding I did during work to make things more efficient, which is at least another 3-4 hours per workday. 


-	I did take about 6-8 weeks off in total throughout the whole process though. You’ll burn out sometimes, and that’s okay! If you’re as driven and passionate as I was, you’ll come back to it weeks later, maybe even a month.


-	Lastly, reddit is a place of vast knowledge of the field. Use it, go to r/learnprogramming or r/datascience or r/jobs or r/personalfinance. There will be questions and topics covering a lot of what I covered here.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**Quick start guide for data science:**


(in no particular order)


-	Introduction to Computer Science with Python from Edx.org


-	Either:


o	Andrew Ng’s Machine learning via coursera (not in python, but teaches you to know the matrix manipulation fundamentals)


o	Statistical Learning via Stanford Lagunita (more theory than programming understanding, but covers similar concepts, and introduces R which is also a good tool)


-	Python Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp via Udemy
Again, this is just to get started. Google and stackoverflow will take you to the next level and other courses will fill the knowledge gaps. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


Full list of courses I’ve completed:

https://www.wired.com/story/zillow-ibuyer-real-estate/

This is a good lesson for data scientists. Zillow made a huge bet on their housing price prediction algorithm and lost billions in the process (at least 32 Billion in market cap).

Just because your algorithm predicts well in a test environment, doesn't mean other intangible factors can derail it in the real world. In this case, seller's feelings, housing layout, and local market conditions.

My question is, where was the pilot in this? This seems like executives got too eager to use this and pushed it out on a massive scale without getting enough feedback. Also, overall market conditions could have caused some bias here, rewarding poor decision making when prices were skyrocketing over the past year, and now that the market is more saturated, reality is setting in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/qwqbxn/zillow_loses_billions_on_house_price_prediction/

datascience,hipozj,Landed my first full time job today - Data Engineering,TheStampTramp,1593531525.0,Job Search,696,0.98,"Hello everyone,

I have been browsing this and other related subs (r/cscareerquestionsEU, r/datascience, etc) for a long time now looking for advice on my journey to find a full-time job and our field in general. I graduated from my Master's program (major in ML, from a top tier university in Germany) this year in March and have been looking for full-time positions in the area for about 6 months now. Today I had a Zoom interview with a company (eCommerce) I had been in touch with for the past couple of weeks and about an hour ago, they called me saying they were really impressed and the job is basically mine if I want it. I am absolutely elated.

To give an idea about my job search process if it gives anyone a perspective being in a similar position, I applied for a total of 222 positions in the areas of Data Science, ML Engineering, Data Engineering, and a handful of Software Development positions as well (CV was same for every application and cover letter was modified a little bit depending on the company - in most cases, it was also the same. Perhaps that explains so many straight-up rejections).

**Ghosted:** 118.

**Outright rejections**: 68.

**Rejections after the technical stage**: 14.

**Still in the process** (applied less than 10 days ago and haven't heard): 22.

**Offers**: 2 (the other one is ML Engineer).

&#x200B;

I feel I am a little above average when it comes to programming but I do have a theoretical understanding of ML algorithms (master's helped), so that helped in some interviews. Regarding the choice between the offers, I feel I am gonna go with the Data Engineering one since there is a lot of room to learn new frameworks which I did not experience in academia (PySpark, Airflow, etc.), there is room to turn into a Data Scientist as the project continues and because the location is excellent.

There were a few days where I was really depressed about my rejections (especially when I got one or two emails in the morning) but I made myself resilient by thinking that the rejections don't matter much (especially the ones given without any interview) and kept on learning and applying. If you are in a similar position, keep on going. Things will turn for the better. :)

&#x200B;

EDIT: Just wanted to add a couple of things since this post is getting a bit of attention. I had a grade of 1.7/5 (in Europe/Germany, 1 is the best you can have and 4 is the worst; anything lower is failing) in my Master's. I had one and a half years of part-time working experience and I was a Teaching Assistant for two years for an ML/DL course in my program.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/hipozj/landed_my_first_full_time_job_today_data/

datascience,gv3i57,"So many people disappointed with their jobs. You need to manage your expectations, especially if you're very junior.",MonthyPythonista,1591086776.0,Discussion,692,0.96,"&#x200B;

I keep seeing threads on this forum about how disappointed so many people are with their data science jobs.

&#x200B;

I think expectations need to be managed, in any line of work:

1. **Seniority / juniority**:  When you start as a medical doctor, you won't start by diagnosing Dr. House-like rare, life-threatening conditions straight away. If you join a law firm, you won't start by passionately and single-handedly defending your clients in court like in a John Grisham book. If you join Goldman Sachs as a graduate, you won't start by managing multi-billion trades and investments straight away. **Any job has a certain amount of grunt work, which is greater at the very beginning of your career**. The world is full of bright kids disappointed with their first jobs, wondering: ""did I really study 3/4/5 years to change the colours of a PowerPoint slide?"".
2. **Importance within the organisation**: this varies wildly from place to place but, generally, regardless of the guff HR says, in many organisations there is a clear difference in the food chain between the functions which are seen as generating revenues and those which are seen as support functions. In many places, the sales team (or equivalent) brings home the money, and everyone else is seen as a support function. You don't need to argue with me that this is shortsighted: you need to understand that this attitude is common, need to do your homework on what the culture is like before joining a company, and make your decisions accordingly.
3. **(related to #2): what is the background of the senior people?** If you are a data scientist in a company where most senior executives have some kind of technical background, you are more likely to be appreciated than in a company where the senior guys (it's almost always guys...) are all salespeople who go into sensory shutdown the moment you mention anything more complicated than the times tables.
4. **what are the real needs of the business?** Even in the most enlightened organisation, with the most technical sensible competent open-minded etc etc executives, **there will be more need for boring work than for exciting, cutting-edge work**. For every person that must do proper R&D and brand-new, cutting edge models processes technologies etc, there will need to be many more people that must manage and maintain the existing processes and models, which is important even if less interesting",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gv3i57/so_many_people_disappointed_with_their_jobs_you/

datascience,m71ijk,Imposter syndrome and prioritizing what to learn,dfphd,1615990949.0,,667,0.99,"Imposter syndrome comes up in this sub a lot, and as someone who feels like he has (mostly) learned to manage it, I wanted to share my experience with it - and what was ultimately my major breakthrough.

In a nutshell, there are three ideas that you need to get in your head in order to get over imposter syndrome:

1. You are a generally competent person
2. There are always going to be people that know more about a certain area of data science than you *and that's ok and expected.* Even more importantly: you're not the smartest person in the planet, so if you look hard enough you're going to find people that are better than you at everything you do *and that's ok.*
3. You have a finite amount of time to learn things, and your goal shouldn't be to learn the most, but to learn the things that maximize your specific goals - generally, this is going to be career advancement, but for some it may be something else. 

In that order.

I think that, generally, imposter syndrome shows up in a thought cycle that goes the opposite direction. That is:

1. You don't have enough time to learn something you want to learn.
2. You look around and see that there are other people that know that thing you don't have time to learn
3. You feel incompetent

So when you feel that, flip it: 

1. Remind yourself that you are a competent person - if you weren't, you wouldn't have gotten to the position you are in right now, whether that's graduating from college or leading a data science team (yes, even DS team leaders catch the 'drome from time to time).
2. Remind yourself that when you look for people who know more than you about a specific area, you are guaranteed to find them - that's just how it works. People choose to specialize in certain areas, and if you only focus on that area of expertise, you are going to feel inadequate. But even more importantly, recognize that if you run into someone who is better than you at literally everything you do, that doesn't diminish your value - it just means you have run into someone that is pretty special\*
3. Get back to prioritizing what to learn. Do you *need* to learn that or do you just *want* to learn it to feel better about yourself? If the latter, learn to let it go, and focus on the things you need to learn - and save the things you want to learn for when you have the time, which will come.

\* As an anecdote - my first encounter with this scenario was a professor that literally did everything I liked doing - but better. He was a tenured professor at a top school, he had come \*this\* close to being a professional soccer player, and he was a classically trained musician, was in incredibly shape for his age and was a generally charming dude. I was a fumbling grad student who played recreational soccer poorly and played in a shitty metal band that no one ever went to see play, out of shape and generally a not-so-charming dude. 

It made me *incredibly* self-conscious for about a minute until I realized ""wait up... this guy is just an abject abnormality of humanity. I shouldn't feel bad about myself, I should just be impressed by how smart and accomplished this guy is *because 99.99999% of the population would be looking up at him too"".*

That helped me later in life when I would encounter people who I felt were just fundamentally smarter people than me. In particular, I remember hiring someone for my team that was so smart and thinking ""there is a better chance that I am going to be working for her in 10 years than the other way around"" *and being ok with that.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/m71ijk/imposter_syndrome_and_prioritizing_what_to_learn/

I have access to Python and R and I am equally skilled in both, but I always find myself falling back to the beautiful Tidyverse of dplyr, stringr, pipes and friends over pandas. The real game changer for me is the %>% pipe operator, it's wonderful to work with. I can do all preprocessing in one long chain without making a single variable, while in pandas I find myself swamped with df, df_no_nulls, df_no_nulls_norm etc. etc. (INB4 choose better variable names but you get my point). The best part about the chain is that it is completely debuggable as it's not nested. The group_by/summarise/mutate/filter grammar is really really good at it's job in comparison to pandas, particularly mutate. The only thing I wish R had that Python has is list comprehension, but there are a ton of things I wish pandas did better that R's Tidyverse does. 

Of course, all the good ML frameworks are written in Python that blows R out of the water further down the pipeline.

It is very common in industry, especially non-tech, for stakeholders to ask for a ""proof of concept"" quickly. I'm going to build one live :)

On **Thursday July 21** around **830pm EDT**, I will be doing a livestream on Twitch with a dataset I have never analyzed, and working on a machine learning solution while live streaming :) I will analyze the dataset, prep it for a modeling problem, and try to build and optimize a model while also unlocking business-driven insights :) And, yes, this does include searching Stack Overflow and debugging along the way! During the stream, I will be talking about my career path, how I got to where I am at, and offering insight into the successes and failures of my career.

datascience,jpljoo,First Year As A Data Scientist Reflection,dope_as_soap,1604728081.0,Career,659,0.98,"It's wild to think it's been a year since I first became a data scientist, and I wanted to share some of the lessons I've learned so far.

**1. The Data Science Title Is Meaningless**

I still have no idea what a ""typical"" data scientist is, and many companies have no idea either. A data science role is very dependent on the company and the maturity of their data infrastructure. Instead of a title, focus on what business problems are present for a particular company and how your skillset in data can solve it. Want to build data products? Then chase those business problems! Interested in using deep learning? Find companies with the infrastructure and problems that warrant such methods. Chasing data problems instead of titles will put you in a better place.

**2. Ask More Questions Before Coding**

I've been burned a few times learning that most non-data people have no idea what data solution they need. Jumping straight into coding after getting a request will set you up for failure. Take a step back and ask probing questions for further clarification. Many times you will find that someone will ask for ""ABC"" but after further questions they actually need ""XYZ"". This skill of getting clarity and consensus among stakeholders, regarding data problems and solutions, is such an important facet of being an effective data scientist.

**3. Prototype to Build Buy In**

Start with a simple example, get feedback, implement feedback, then repeat. This process saves you time and makes your stakeholders feel heard/valued. For example, I recently had to create an algorithm to classify our product's users. Rather than jumping straight into python, I created a slide deck describing the algorithms logic visually and an excel spreadsheet of different use cases. I presented these prototypes to stakeholders and then implemented their feedback into the prototype. By the end of this process it was clear as to what I needed to code and the stakeholders understood what value my data solution would bring to them.

**4. Talk to Domain Experts**

You end up making A LOT of assumptions about the data. Talking to domain experts of your data subject and or product will help you make better assumptions. Go talk to Sales or Customer Success teams to learn about customer pain points. Talk to engineers to learn why certain product decisions were made. If it's a specific domain, talk to a subject matter expert to learn whether there is an important nuance about the data or if it's a data quality issue.

**5. Learn Software Engineering Best Practices**

Notebooks are awesome for experimenting and data exploration, but they can only take you so far. Learn how to build scripts for your data science workflow instead of just using notebooks. Take advantage of git to keep track of your code. Write unit tests to make sure your code is working as expected. Put effort into how you structure your code (e.g. functions, separate scripts, etc.). This will help you stand out as a data scientist, as well as make it way easier to put your data solutions into production.

There is probably more, but these are the topics top of mind for me right now! Would love to hear what other data scientist have learned as well!",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/jpljoo/first_year_as_a_data_scientist_reflection/

datascience,hecc72,Why the ability to concentrate is the most important skill in 2020,Karlos224,1592909031.0,Career,650,0.96,"Many of us usually have at least one thing that we know we need to do. And if somehow we managed to sit down and do it from start to finish. Our life would be better because of it. The problem is that people put off that thing, they do anything under the sun to distract themselves.

Being a person who naturally gets distracted easily and was surely one of the worst procrastinators. I can confidently say it's never too late to make a change. Because if somehow even I managed to find little strategies and create little short cuts to become someone who can concentrate for long periods of time. Then you can too!

\#1 Why it's so important?

First of all, it's probably not a secret that getting sidetracked nowadays is easier than ever. We are constantly bombarded with ads and online marketing. In fact, according to research, it takes around 15-20 min. to get back to your 100% concentration after getting distracted. Basically, if we cut to the chase - this new distracting digital age creates a huge demand for people who can resist distraction and concentrate.

2#The bar is so lower than you think

If you can dive in even for one hour on your most important thing for the day with a ruthless and intense focus. You will make substantial progress in your life. And as you get used to that hour of concentration. You can upgrade that to 2 or 3 hours. Just think how much intense focus that is. You will skyrocket past your goals!

3# Guilt-free pleasure and balance

I know that many of us want to have a balanced life. We want to achieve something or do something meaningful but still enjoy life. For example, maybe you want to work on your personal projects, but at the same time, you don't want to give up video games. This was one of the biggest pains I struggled myself. I would play a lot of video games but then at the same time I would feel guilty for not making progress on my personal goals. And it's funny because the solution is so simple. You can play the crap out of those video games after you put a tremendous amount of focus on something else. This way you don't feel guilty and can fully immerse yourself into video games.

And if the perks of mastering concentration don't entice you, you can stop here...

datascience,gf9hrs,What makes a good personal project - from the perspective of a hiring manager,dfphd,1588867985.0,,640,0.99,"We often see the question on this sub around ""how do I build a portfolio as a student?"", i.e., what projects should I work on?

If the resumes I've reviewed over the last 5 years are any indication, most people seem to think that the answer is a Jupyter Notebook that takes a pretty standard dataset, does EDA, builds a model, and presents a bunch of plots showing quality of fit.

From my perspective, these projects are pretty much useless. I say that because odds are that I can figure out if you can build such a notebook by just asking you a handful of questions and spending 5 minutes talking to you. Most importantly, being able to do that for a project that you chose (whether personal or capstone project) makes this project worthless in terms of helping me evaluate how you overcome obstacles - odds are that the way your overcame obstacles was by choosing a project that was easy to do and had relatively clean, available data.

So how do you make a better personal project?

**Start with a problem statement that is actually useful, even if you don't know how to solve it**

As a rule of thumb, an imperfect solution to a useful problem is better than a perfect solution to a useless one. I'd rather see you build a linear regression model to solve something that people actually care about instead of building a deep learning model to predict Titanic deaths. Why? Because problems that matter show a hiring manager that you can think through how to use data science to drive value. And if the process of getting there sends you down some windy roads, it also shows the hiring manager that you're able to navigate them. These are two *really* important skillsets.

Mind you, when I say ""useful"" I don't mean ""important"". I'm not telling you that you need to go find a cure for cancer, just to focus on something that *someone* will find a user for.

Example:

* Building a  model to optimize a fantasy football lineup.

Again, not important - just useful.

**Focus on a problem that goes beyond predicting a single metric**

A lot of data science ""side projects"" that I see focus on predicting a single quantity. While sometimes you will find yourself doing that in a work setting, most of the time your work goes beyond that, meaning you are normally predicting a quantity so that you can then influence a decision process, or estimate a broader outcome, etc.

So if you're going to work on a side project, try to follow through your model ""all the way"", i.e., through to an actual outcome that could be useful.

Example:

* Don't just predict the number of points a player will score in fantasy football - actually build that into a model that can help someone make decisions in a more complex setting (like daily fantasy football, or evaluating draft strategies).

**Start with ugly, raw data if you can**

If you start your project with mostly clean, post-processed data you've already skipped a big step in terms demonstrating what you can do. If instead you choose to go for something that isn't in its final form, you can flex a couple of different muscles.

For example, you could scrape data. Not super complicated, but it already shows me an extra skillset. Or you could start with data in log format and writing the necessary scripts to convert it into tabular form.

Example:

* Instead of starting with aggregate NFL stats, start with NFL play-by-play logs and write a script to convert ""S.Barkley runs for 10 yard loss PENALTY Holding: NYG REJECTED"" into the appropriate statline.

**If possible, build an actual product - not just analysis**

Building a product allows you a couple of advantages. For one, it allows you to just share a link to something that people can actually use. Secondly, if your tool were to get any traffic, it allows you to validate your idea. Lastly, it allows you to flex a completely different muscle - the fact that you can think through basic (or advanced) designs and deploy a solution to an environment.

Example:

* Build a web-app where people can make selections and your tool will output a recommended lineup in fantasy football.

**Work alone**

One of the big issues with group projects outside of a work setting is that it's hard for a hiring manager to corroborate what you did personally vs. what others did. That means that some hiring managers may just choose to assume that you didn't have a part in all of it - and worse, that you don't have all of those skills.

If you work by yourself, you can guarantee that an interviewer will assume that you did all of it, and there will be no questions of what you can/cannot do.

Some may say ""but group projects show that I can work in a team!"". And I think everyone that has ever worked in a group project knows that they seldom punish the person in a group who most lazy and hardest to work with. 

Obviously this is just my opinion, but since the topic comes up often I figured it was worth putting it down to at least start a conversation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gf9hrs/what_makes_a_good_personal_project_from_the/

Just wanted to give back because I benefitted a lot from previous posts and resources, and the Data Science hiring process is not standardised, which makes it harder to find good information about companies.

# On BigTech

I’d like to provide an overview over the steps of Big Tech companies that recruit for Data Scientist positions in the EU. I will copy this straight from my notes so all of these come from actual interviews. If there’s no salary info it means I didn’t get to discuss it with them because I dropped out of the process for whatever reason before I ended up signing my offer. In total I spoke with around 40 companies and ended up having 3 different offers, went to 6 final round interviews and stopped some processes because I found a great match in the meantime.

**Booking.com**

Salary: €95k + 15pct Bonus

Interviews:

1. Recruiter call
2. Hackerrank test (2 questions, 1 multiple choice, 1 exercise)
3. 2 Technical interviews:
   1. 20 minutes past projects, real case from Booking for solving it,
   2. Second interview: different case, same system
4. Behavorial interview

**Spotify**

Salary: €85-€90k + negotiable bonus

Process:

1. Recruiter call
2. Hiring manager interview, mostly behavorial but there was some exercise on Bayes’ Theorem that involved calculating some probabilities and using conditional + total probability.
3. Technical screening, coding exercise (Python / SQL). SQL was easy but they do ask Leetcode questions!
4. Presentation + Case Study (take home)
5. Modeling exercise
6. Stakeholder interview

**Facebook/Meta (Data Scientist - Product Analytics)**

I lost my notes but the process was very concise! Regardless of the product, their recruitment process was one of the most pleasant ones I’ve had. Also they have TONS of prep material. I think it went down like this:

1. Recruiter call
2. Technical screen SQL, but you can also use Python / pandas. Actually they said they’re flexible so you could probably even ask for doing it in R
3. Product interviews (onsite)

**Zalando**

I did not have any recruiter call, they just sent me an invitation for the tech screen and there would be only 2 steps involved

1. Technical screening with probability brainteaser (Think of dice throwing and expected value of a certain value after N iterations), explaining logistic regression „mathematically“, live coding (in my case implement TF-IDF) and a/b testing case
2. Onsite with 3-4 interviews

**Wolt**

1. Recruiter screen
2. Hiring manager interview, mostly behavioral
3. Take home assignment. This one is BIG, the deadline was 10 days and they wanted an EDA, training & fitting multiple ML models on a classification task, and then also doing a high level presentation for another case without any data
4. Discussion of the take home + technical questions
5. Stakeholder interview

**DoorDash**

1. Recruiter screen
2. Technical screen + Product case. Think of SQL questions in the technical but you can also use R or Python. They ask 4 questions in 30 mins so be quick! Product case is very generic.
3. Onsite interview with mostly product cases and behaviorals

**Delivery Hero**

1. Recruiter interview
2. Hiring manager interview
3. Codility test, SQL + Python
4. Panel interview: 3 people from the team, focus on behavioural
5. Stakeholder interview: largely behavioural
6. Bar raiser interview: this is Amazon style, live coding + technical questions

# Some other mentions:

**Amazon + Uber**

Sorry, they keep ghosting me :D

**Klarna**

Just a hint: they’re hiring as crazy for data science, I got contacted by them but the recruiter didn’t have any positions that would match my level so we didn’t proceed further. I was a bit sad about this because they’re growing, the product is hot and they may IPO soon.

**QuantCo**

Because I have some different 3rd party recruiter in my mailbox every week: They pay very well, I was told the range is up to 230k / y. 140k base + negotiable spread between bonus and equity. They’re not public so I wouldn’t want to sit on their equity. Anyway, I responded twice to that and got ghosted twice from different recruiters. I would recommend ignoring them.

**Revolut**

They contacted me but I decided to not pursue this further because of their horrible reputation and the way their CEO communicates in public.

**Wayfair**

I interviewed with a couple of people who have worked there before as head of something, no one was particularly excited. I applied there once for a senior data analyst position and they sent me an automated 4 hour long codility test. I opened it but decided to drop out of the process.

# On the general salary situation

For senior data science roles outside of big tech I think a reasonable range to end up at is €70k-90k. In big tech you can expect €80-100k base comp + 10-15% bonus / stocks. I’m sure there’s people who can do a lot better but for me this seemed to be my market value. There are some startups I didn’t want to mention here that can pay pretty well because they’re US backed (they acquire a lot recently), but usually their workload is also a lot higher, so it depends how much you value additional money vs WLB.

[levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) is very (!) accurate if the company is big enough for having data there. Should be the case for all big tech companies btw.

# On interview prep

There’s already great content out there!

While I don’t agree with everything here (like working on weekends and being so religious about the prep), I think the JPM top comment summed up how the prep should be done quite well: [https://www.teamblind.com/post/Have-DS-interviews-gotten-harder-in-the-past-few-years-WbYfzXbE](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Have-DS-interviews-gotten-harder-in-the-past-few-years-WbYfzXbE)

I also read this article many times: [https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ox9h2j/two\_months\_of\_virtual\_faangmula\_ds\_interviews/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ox9h2j/two_months_of_virtual_faangmula_ds_interviews/)

I have to say that I started prepping way too late, basically while I was already knee deep into interviewing, but it worked out well anyway.

**SQL:**

Stratascratch is great if you want to practice for a specific company, but Leetcode will prep you more generally imo. I recommend getting a premium for both actually, even though it's expensive. I just took a one-time monthly subscription (be sure to cancel it immediately after booking it as they will just keep charging you).

**Which Leetcode questions to practice:** [https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/)

I honestly didn’t see a lot of Leetcode style questions but they do sometimes ask about it and then you're happy if you recognize the question

**If you need to dive deep into probability theory:** [https://mathstat.slu.edu/\~speegle/\_book/probchapter.html#probabilitybasics](https://mathstat.slu.edu/~speegle/_book/probchapter.html#probabilitybasics). I honestly bombed all probability brainteasers I got asked. It can make you feel stupid but looking back at my undergrad material (which is a veeeeery long time ago) I realized that I was once upon a time able to answer these kinds of questions, I just don’t need them for work. Given that they’re rarely asked I wouldn’t focus on this too much honestly.

**For general machine learning & stats:**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9V07EIfIg&list=PLOg0ngHtcqbPTlZzRHA2ocQZqB1D\_qZ5V&index=1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9V07EIfIg&list=PLOg0ngHtcqbPTlZzRHA2ocQZqB1D_qZ5V&index=1) This video series was my bible. IMO it covers everything you’ll need in data science interviews about machine learning. Honestly, no-one ever asked me anything more complicated than logistic regression or how random forests work on a high level. For reading things up [I also can’t recommend the ISLR book enough](https://www.statlearning.com/)

**On product interviews:**[https://vimeo.com/385283671/ec3432147b](https://vimeo.com/385283671/ec3432147b) I watched this video by Facebook many times. I think if you use their techniques you’ll easily pass most product interviews.

# On recruiter calls

These are really easy imo, in the later stage I had an 80-90% success rate. I made a script for my intro and it took around 4-5 minutes to say everything. This is quite long also because I make sure I speak slowly and clearly when introducing myself, but the structure is the roughly like this:

1. Brief introduction on background + specializations (if you’re really, I mean REALLY good at ML modeling feel free to mention right in the beginning that this is how you’re perceived at work
2. Overview over your current department / team
3. What is your work mode (e.g. cross functional teams, embedded data scientist, data science team)
4. What kind of projects have you worked on
5. What is the scope of those projects (end-to-end, workshops, short projects). It also helps to give a ballpark of their usual timeframe
6. What are your responsibilities in those projects
7. What is your tech-stack / Alternatively: give examples throughout the projects of where you e.g. work with sklearn, pandas, …

I have made great experiences with that. Usually I apologise if I feel that I was going into too much detail or spoke too long, but so far everyone was fine with this and it is imo a great entry point for further discussions. I use this intro also for every other time I meet someone new.

# On hiring manager calls

These are imo quite easy, it’s usually more about the team fit and you shouldn’t have problems if you prepared with the Facebook material. Have some stories about projects ready as they usually ask you about at least 1 or 2 of them. Get familiar with answering questions in the STAR format.

I sometimes made the experience that they’re a bit pushy with their questions. If you feel that they’re focusing a lot on a specific project where you might feel that it’s not the most relevant for the role I recommend leading the direction politely away from there. I sometimes experienced that they were asking many questions about a rather simple model where I also didn’t do any ETL/database work. I recommend saying something in the way of „while surely an ARIMA model is useful, I would like to emphasise that we normally use it as a baseline because it’s easy to explain, but I do prefer increasing the complexity if the project allows for that, as I did for example in project Z. As this was one of my most impactful projects so far I’d love to elaborate on that as well if you’re okay with that, as I want to give you the best possible overview on my skillset and areas of interest.“ If they keep pushing about that not so relevant project I would consider it a red flag honestly and I had such cases before, even though they were very rare.

# On salary negotiations

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyn0CKPuPlA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyn0CKPuPlA)

Let me just leave these here.

# On take home assignments

I’ve done a few of them. I learned a lot from them. I hated every single one of them. I hated Leetcode even more in the beginning, but I’ve started to appreciate it, because take homes are just so arbitrary. As I had advanced talks with a couple companies, I skipped more and more of them. At some point I started telling companies that I don’t have time to do them due to other commitments and pending offers. The ones that were enthusiastic about hiring me moved me forward anyway. The ones where I didn’t leave a great impression told me it’s a requirement. So my advice is: If you’re willing to walk away from the process, decline them. It’s not respectful of our time. In one case I told a company that I can’t do it but I’m happy to explain how I’d approach it in detail in a call, otherwise I’d have to withdraw my application. The take home was very extensive, evaluate a large public dataset, do the EDA, fit some models, build an API, dockerize it and show you’ll make a prediction from the worker. They were a bit unorganised and scheduled a meeting about it, but the one evaluating it was super surprised that I didn’t prepare anything. We ended up coding a toy model and deploying it anyway and they forwarded me in the process anyway. Again, I would only recommend this if you’re willing to walk away from the offer, for me this was 50/50.

# On scheduling interviews

In general, bigger companies move slower, but I would suggest mass applying once you’re talking to a few of your favourites. I started practicing on unimportant roles about 1-2 months before I went hardcore with interviewing. I recommend not accepting any offers too early, the market is crazy right now! However, once you have an offer and you had at least a chat with the recruiter or better the hiring manager for a role, even big tech companies can move quickly! After my first offer I had many processes expedited and completed in 2-3 weeks.

# On anything else

Feel free to ask here. As this is a throwaway I won’t check my DM, but I will try to answer any publicly posted questions. Good luck everyone!",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/syjt0c/hopefully_almost_everything_you_need_to_know/

datascience,h96nz8,Keep a Brag Document,ibsurvivors,1592186086.0,Career,638,0.98,"Hi everyone,

Thought I'd share some advice that has helped me so far in my Data Science career. It has to do with recording your wins at work - hope you like it!

\-----

The human brain is terrible at remembering information.

When we try to use the past to predict the future, we end up using *our memory* of the past. And our memory is extremely flawed, subject to whims and emotions.

One of the biggest consequences of this is at work.

You clock in 9-5 for days on days and then when you look back at what you did a year ago, you think “Where did all that time go?”

Even worse, if YOU can’t remember what the hell you did, how will your boss?

In an ideal world: you do a great job, your company rewards you. They’ll notice all the hard work you’re putting in. All the beautiful lines of code you’ve written.

But we don’t live in an ideal world. And the costliest mistake you can make in your career is not being proactive about recording your achievements and your little wins.

**Enter The Brag Document**

I first read about a Brag Document on [Julia Evan’s blog](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/#template).

By recording your small wins and accomplishments on a weekly basis, you accumulate concrete evidence of what you’ve achieved.

And these “wins” don’t need to be Olympic Gold Medals.

Did you help a coworker understand how to use an API? Jot it down.

Did you anticipate a nasty bug and proactively reach out about it? It goes on there.

Did you help mentor a junior employee? That’s definitely part of it.

Over time, I promise you, your brag document will do wonders for your career.

Sure - negotiating a raise or getting a promotion will become easier. In fact, come performance review time, even your boss will thank you for it. Those things are hard to write from pure memory. More on this a bit later.

But the biggest benefit of a brag document lies in identifying *what you enjoy doing*.

Your wins are likely a representation of tasks you enjoyed. And you should be very proactive about focusing on those tasks going forward.

Use your Brag Document to ruthlessly identify the tasks you want to spend more time on, as well as the tasks you don’t want to do anymore.

**The Pareto Principle**

The Pareto Principle states that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

At work, 80% of what you can feel proud about will stem from 20% of what you do. You can think of your Brag Document as representing that 20%.

Use this 20% to ask yourself questions like:

* Is there a common theme amongst this work?
* Are there topics here that I thought I didn’t actually like but turns out I do?
* How much of this work involves collaboration with other departments / teams?
* How can I do more of this work?

**Frequency**

Update your brag document on a weekly basis. You can set it as a recurring event on your calendar.

The biggest benefit of this is that it forces you to scrutinize your output on a regular basis and allows you to be proactive about focusing on the work you want to do.

Let’s say that after a few weeks of work, you genuinely have nothing to put on your brag document.

There’s a chance you had a bit of a slow period at work, but maybe you’re just stuck somewhere you don’t want to be?

**Collaborate**

Talk about your brag document with co-workers. Ask them what you think you should put on yours.

You’ll often find that they’re able to mention things you completely forgot or didn’t even seem to think about.

Remember - just because something seems easy *to you* doesn’t mean it’s easy in general. 5 minutes of work may have taken you 10 years to learn.

You should also encourage your team to keep their own brag documents. Help each other be accountable and celebrate each other’s wins. This builds a strong team culture.

**Your Manager**

You should try to share your brag document with your manager once a quarter.

It might seem **weird** or **unnatural** \- you’re basically dumping all your achievements into their lap. But this actually really makes their life easier.

If your manager ever needs to vouch for you internally, then boom - they have direct evidence they can use. If your manager needs to reshuffle workload, then they know what you’re good at and what you can improve on.

Even better, you and your manager should go through your brag document together.

Tell them what you want to do more of. Tell them what you wish was on there more.

You’ll both be able to identify areas in which you’re doing a great job and also areas in which your manager perhaps wants you to focus on more.

Another aspect that’s helpful here is with goal setting - your manager and you likely work together anyway to determine quarterly goals.

You should use your brag document to help you identify what type of goals you need to be hitting. Very often, we will achieve goals and then think “Wait..what was the point again?”

By using your brag document to set goals, you’ll be much more likely to be working towards something that you find rewarding.

**Ending thoughts**

Once you start getting in the habit of using a brag document, operating without one will feel like doing your work in the dark.

Over time, you’ll develop a much clearer picture of the type of work that you want to focus on for your career.

datascience,uo589a,Why are companies willing to spend so much on hiring new employees but on retaining them?,ibsurvivors,1652373471.0,Career,632,0.97,"In April 2021, I got a 40% raise. That’s a pretty big raise.

But it didn’t make me feel very good. In fact, it made me realize that I had been leaving money on the table for almost two years.

I would never have got that raise unless I fought for it. Unless I typed the email and stuck my neck out, demanding what I was worth.

The experience taught me an important lesson:

Retention measures (like pay raises) are reactive, not proactive. If your company feels that you're happy there, they won’t pay you more.

In this post, I’m going to tell you that the data back this up, why this is the case, and what you can do about it.

**Salary compression**

Salary compression is what happens when companies don’t raise employees' salaries, but pay higher wages to attract new talent.

This imbalance between spending on new hires and existing workers has resulted in historic pay compression, with the gap between the wages of 20- to 24-year-olds (a reliable proxy for new hires) and 25- to 34-year-olds having shrunk to its smallest size in 36 years.

And this actually tends to impact the tech industry more so than others:

https://preview.redd.it/rmujs5im8zy81.png?width=1632&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2006ac9becb77372725a626a661118dfcf84ce62

TLDR: employers are giving way more money to new hires compared to their existing employees.

This is pretty surprising considering the cost of replacing someone is high. Companies have to:

1. Absorb hiring costs
2. Search in a competitive market for talent
3. Distract team members for another round of interviews
4. Deal with onboarding costs and lack of productivity for first three months of new hire

So why does this happen?

Here are two possible reasons:

**Possible Reason #1: Retention efforts take time**

Solid retention efforts and policies are the type of initiatives that are hard to measure and work over a long period of time, like 5 to 10 years.

And those are often things that can’t be prioritized because of the hypergrowth nature of the tech industry. Investors want to see results now.

Some companies will spend a lot of time and effort to pay the least amount of money they can per role. They take pride in that. It’s much easier to just bring new people in.

Unfortunately, I don’t think it’s the right way to think about the world if you want to be a great company.

**Possible Reason #2: Their career ladder strategy isn't developed**

One of the most common things that happens, especially at high growth startups, is that your workload increases beyond the tasks of your original role, but your salary doesn’t change.

Defining these internal career growth ladders is actually quite time consuming. And so if it’s not been well defined, then there’s no real precedent for you to get a raise.

In these cases, it’s not even the case that the company doesn’t want to give you a raise, it’s just that they haven’t done the work to establish what the next step looks like.

**What this means for you**

First, you need to realize that salary is just one element of your total compensation package. There are a *lot of* factors you can negotiate with that are outside of your base compensation. A quick list:

* Remote work
* Number of holidays
* Professional development opportunities
* Health and wellness benefits
* Bonuses
* Stock options or other long term incentives
* Your hours
* Projects you get to work on

Second, I encourage you to keep in mind that [money isn’t everything](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/motivators-hygiene-factors). It’s pretty cliché but if you’re learning a ton, I don’t think you need to keep money at the forefront of your mind.

For example, at my last company, the first 12 months were great. I was learning something new everyday and my salary didn’t matter too much to me, because I was in “learning” mode.

The 6 months after that, though, were rough. When I stopped enjoying my work, all the focus became about my salary. And when I got the raise that I wanted, I realized that I was staying for the wrong reasons.

So if you think the raise is going to solve your job satisfaction problems, keep in mind that it probably won’t.

But you deserve to get paid what you’re worth. And if you’re not, it’s time to change that.

Here are three principles you should keep in mind when negotiating a raise:

**Principle #1: It's all about the evidence**

Identify your [top two accomplishments](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/howtobragatwork) over the last 6-8 months. Pick ones that have a quantifiable impact. This is your ammunition.

Present this info however you want, but make it as easy as possible for your boss to vouch for you. Don’t make him do any unnecessary work - ideally, it should literally be him having to just forward the evidence you’ve presented (via a deck or a document) to his higher ups and then they discuss it.

Also have a clear salary number in mind. There’s plenty of ways to come up with a number - do research on sites like Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, H1BData, or maybe even reach out to others in the industry.

Once you have a clear number, bump it up by 15-20%.

**Principle #2: Keep your emotions out of it**

*“Anger is our friend. Not a nice friend. Not a gentle friend. But a very, very loyal friend… It will always tell us when we have betrayed ourselves.”* \- Julia Cameron, The Artist’s Way

Anger can be good. But it’s not in your best interests to be angry when negotiating.

Instead, you want to be firm and solution-oriented. That means that you’re not fighting against your boss or the company - you’re on the same team figuring out how you can do your best work.

For example, if you give a number and they come back with one that you’re unhappy with, instead of getting angry you can simply respond: “That doesn’t work for me. I’m curious how you arrived at that number. Can we walk through it?”

When you keep your emotions out of it, you’ll focus on how the promotion benefits **them** first and not you. And that’s what they want to hear.

**Principle #3: Timing matters**

If you have a performance review coming up in 3 months, don’t wait for 2.5 months to bring up your desire for a raise. Start early. Your boss will need time.

Two other tips:

1/ Try bringing this up after you’ve successfully completed a great project. Recency bias is real.

2/ If you’re purely trying to maximize your money, the way to do it is to get a competing offer and ask your current company to match it or go above. But you’ve got to be prepared to leave. High risk, high reward.

\*\*\*

One last thing.

No one is waking up every day thinking, “Is Shikhar happy in his job? Is he appreciated? Is he fairly compensated?”

I owe it to myself to advocate being paid fairly for my work.

As do you. So go make it happen.

datascience,edgai0,Advice for those entering the workforce: your job is not to be right - and it's certainly not to prove others wrong,dfphd,1576877006.0,,622,0.95,"Thinking back to my days as a first year data scientist, one of the most difficult transitions I've seen people make is how they measure their value.

Because academia is primarily an environment in which you're measured by how right or wrong you are, a lot of people transition into the workplace thinking the same. What's worse, some go further and extend that to the point of thinking that there is value in proving others wrong.

That is fundamentally not going to work. And that is because people in the workplace are measured almost exclusively on how productive they are - they are measured on results.

Corollary 1: if it's wrong but it works, then it's not wrong.

Corollary 2: if you're right but it doesn't change the outcome, then it doesn't matter.

Corollary 3: if you're right, but it doesn't work, then you're wrong. 

Corollary 4: if you prove someone else wrong, but their answer works and yours doesn't, then they're right and you're wrong. 

Corollary 5: if you prove someone's solution to be wrong even though it does provide value, then you have not yet provided any value until you propose something better. 

I cannot emphasize how much you can limit your career by focusing on right vs. wrong. Right vs. wrong is irrelevant; productivity always rules.

EDIT: Since many have had an issue with the definition of something that works vs. something that is wrong:

This is the part that people miss - it is rare that bad science works.

When things that a person sees as ""wrong science"" work, I normally find that the overwhelming majority of the time, if that person is junior, what is actually happening is that:

 1. It's not actually wrong, and the person just doesn't understand why it's right.

 2. It's not 100% right, but it's right enough to provide value. And some people interpret that to mean wrong, which is too binary in the world of modeling. 95% right isn't wrong, it's just 95% right. 

The only scenario where you will see bad science work with any degree of frequency is when it has been tested over too limited a set of scenarios - in which case it should be relatively easy to point out where it will fail, and then you can focus on outputs - on how it won't work, rather than on it being wrong.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/edgai0/advice_for_those_entering_the_workforce_your_job/

datascience,vtzw0b,The Data Science Trap: A Rebuttal,analyzeTimes,1657247524.0,Meta,605,0.95,"More often than not, I see comments on this thread suggesting the dilution of the Data Science discipline into a glorified Data Analyst position. Maybe my 10 years in the Data Science field leads me to possessing a level of naivety, but I’ve concluded that Data Science in its academic interpretation is far from its practicality in application. 

Take for example the rise of VC funding of startups and compare the ROI/success rate of AI-specific startups versus non-AI centric companies. Most AI startups in the past 5 years have failed. Why is this? Overwhelmingly, there is over promise of results with underperformance in value. That simply cannot be blamed on faulty hiring managers. 

Now shift to large market cap institutions. AI and Machine Learning provide value added in specific situations, but not with the prevalence that would support the volume of Data Science positions advertising classic AI/ML…the infrastructure simply doesn’t exist. Instead, entry level Data Scientists enter the workforce expecting relatively clean datasets/sources with proper governance and pedigree when reality slaps them in the face after finding out Fred down the hall has 5 terabytes in a set of disparate hard drives under his desk. (Obviously this is hyperbole but I wouldn’t put it past some users here saying ‘oh shit how do you know Fred?!’) 

These early career individuals who become underwhelmed with industry are not to blame either. Academic institutions have raced ass first toward the cash cow of offering Data Scientist majors and certificates. Such courses are often taught by many professors whose last time in a for-profit firm was during the days where COBAL was a preferred language of choice.  Sure most can reach the topics of AI/ML but can they teach its application in an industry ill-prepared for it?

This leads me to my final word of advice for whomever is seeking it. Regardless of your title (Data Scientist, Data Analyst, ML Engineer, etc), find value in providing value. If you spend 5 months converting a 97.8% accurate model into 99.99% accuracy and net $10K in savings but the intern down the hall netted $10M in savings by simply running a simple regression model after digging into Fred’s desk, who provided more value added?

Those who provide value will be paid the magnitude their contribution necessitates. 

Anyways, be great.

Keep in mind that the folks who post on these forums are not a representative sample. It naturally skews towards people who are drawn to high compensation / level / ""prestige""

Even sources like [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) only show the compensations of people who choose to share it, which again isn't a representative sample. If compensation / level / prestige is what you're after, by all means, go for it and work for it. But comparing yourself to people who  *humble brag* on social media does nothing good for your mental health. [Studies](https://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/) have shown that Instagram is bad for teens' mental health, comparing yourself to the humble braggers on LinkedIn/ Blind / other CS / DS focused social media would likely have a similar impact on your mental health too.

Also keep in mind that on average \~65,000 CS graduates graduate every year in the US. If you include China, India, and Russia the number is more like 460,000 graduates per year, of which \~45,000 are considered elite. My source is this [research article](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/14/6732). Assuming a 15% annual growth rate , that means \~3.5 million CS graduates just in the last 10 years,  (5.5 million in the last 20 years).

Of these, only about 10% (just napkin math based on number of employees in Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and assuming only \~50% of them are ""tech"" roles) can ever work in Big N, and of the 10% there, only about another 10% make it to Staff levels, which is where you see compensations of 500k+ (some seniors can make it too, but it's more reliably available at staff+ levels). And these salaries too are only common in SF Bay Area, Seattle, NYC, and maybe Austin. 

So you're comparing against 1% of an industry that is already on average better paid than most other industries.

My (non-finance) company is currently hiring for a role and over 20% of the resumes we've received have a stock market project with a claim of being over 95% accurate at predicting the price of a given stock. On looking at the GitHub code for the projects, every single one of these projects has not accounted for look-ahead bias and simply train/test split 80/20 - allowing the model to train on future data. A majority of theses resumes have references to MOOCs, FreeCodeCamp being a frequent one. 

I don't know if this stock market project is a MOOC module somewhere, but it's a really bad one and we've rejected all the resumes that have it since time-series modelling is critical to what we do. So if you have this project, please either don't put it on your resume, or if you really want a stock project, make sure to at least split your data on a date and holdout the later sample (this will almost certainly tank your model results if you originally had 95% accuracy).",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/pf9j9s/resume_observation_from_a_hiring_manager/

Here are 10 tips that have helped me greatly in business.,thomasvarekamp,1664394768.0,Career,578,0.97,"I started out as an in-house data scientist and then moved on to data science management consulting. This is where I learned very important soft skills that made me a way better data scientist.

Note: clients in this case can be anyone that gives you an assignment. For example, your manager, an external client, your colleague, etc.

## 10 tips:

1.	**Be helpful, don’t be obedient**. Help your client in the best way possible, but set boundaries on what you will do. Some people see us as these magical creatures that can do everything. Protect yourself from that.
2.	**Small talk is not a waste of time**; it is a social lubricant that increases the client’s confidence in you.
3.	**Adjust your message to the audience.** Check who they are and what is important to them. Also, make sure you use the right terminology (e.g. do not use technical terms when talking to non-technical business people).
4.	**A good presentation is like a good conversation**. Make your point, but also leave room for questions.
5.	**If you do not know the client beforehand, start with an introduction.** Who are you? What is your background? What are your hobbies?
6.	**Nobody likes surprises**. If something unexpected comes up, discuss this with your client as soon as possible.
7.	**Make the client feel that the solution was his or her idea**. Explain all the available options and guide the client to the preferred solution. This depends on what you're working on of course. For example, if you are not sure what data to include, try to involve your client and come up with an answer together.
8.	**The client is not your friend**. Be friendly, but watch what you say about your private life.
9.	The more senior your audience is, **the more to the point you need to be**.
10. Being professional is not about removing emotion. **It is OK to smile** :).
