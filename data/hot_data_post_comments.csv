11dl3sf,jaa5v01,1,Thanks dude. I’ll check this out. I’ve been trying to improve my excel skills
11dl3sf,jaba8u0,1,Thanks
11dgh1t,ja8gc2c,27,"Take the job, and learn how to provide business value from data. Look for opportunities to automate or improve your team’s work using other tools like SQL, Python, Tableau, etc. 

My first analytics job primarily used Adobe Analytics (very similar to GA). I was also able to use R and Power BI on the job. Now I’m a product analytics data scientist - and I still use Adobe Analytics a lot but I also use SQL and Python and do predictive modeling as well."
11dgh1t,ja8pqu1,13,Take the job because any work is better than no work. And it's easier to get job you want in the future while working.
11dgh1t,ja8zlm9,6,I’d advice you to take the job and introduce them more to data
11dgh1t,ja9ddbp,4,"I fully agree with the other advice here, take the job and try and develop your skills that you can apply to your next job."
11dgh1t,jaa3rsz,3,"Google analytics is pretty simple to learn. Find some Youtube videos online. Remember you can always find at least one trusted team member, and make them your go to person for translating what you would have done in the tools you already know into Google Analytics. Then there's also ChatGPT to do that for you.

&#x200B;

Don't sweat it. Learning all those tools show that you're technically gifted. Give yourself some months, do your due diligence in learning as much and as quickly as you can, and you'll be fine!"
11dgh1t,jaamj2b,3,"I used to own an analytics-focused marketing company and have used the Google Analytics API for years.

Here's a project you could work on that would 1) continue to allow you to develop your technical skills and 2) add a lot of value for your company (assuming they're using the Google Analytics UI for all their reporting):

1. Use Stitch Data, Fivetran, or any other ETL tool to push your Google Analytics data into BigQuery, Snowflake, or any other data warehouse. 
   1. If you don't want to use a tool, you could also pull all the data into your data warehouse with Python and then automate with Google Cloud function, Pub/Sub, and Cloud Scheduler.
2. (optional) Use DBT to create staging tables and data models to transform the data into a useful format for reporting
3. Connect your data warehouse to a BI tool (I like using the native connection between BigQuery and Google Data Studio) and build more dynamic reporting than what is offered in the Google Analytics UI.
4. Bonus points for layering in CRM and revenue data into your dashboards

Google Analytics is an AMAZING dataset to build data skills around :)"
11dgh1t,ja9qvtd,2,The current job market is horrible. Take it and run!!!!! Google analytics and adobe analytics are requirements for marketing data analyst jobs and will really help.
11dgh1t,jaa4hkg,1,What kind of clients you will be working for ?
11dgh1t,jab2qpi,1,"Yes, take the job and put the skills to use. The most valuable analysts are those that can figure out how to put their skills to use. 

If you cant figure out how even with GA, you're still very green."

11czods,ja5yow9,57,"I need to understand the business.  I need to be able to learn what is useful for the customer within the business.  I need to be able to develop presentations, exhibits, templates, dashboards, etc. that speak clearly to non-data analytics practitioners.  I need to be able to speak clearly in the language of the business customer.   I need to be able to answer the question ""so what?"" as applied to the reports.  I need to be able to design original research to inform the analytics."
11czods,ja603x0,37,"You already have the tech stack down. Now, you need to learn to become autonomous by learning the business and which metrics or problems need to be solved with insights from data. You do this by reaching out to stakeholders across departments and developing iterations of dashboards/reports. This is how you get promoted.

This is what’s most important in the private sector, increasing business value through insights from data. The last step is most important, delivering those insights in a way that your audience will actually be influenced to make action on what you delivered."
11czods,ja6cmqg,13,I have almost 2 years of experience and I’m making less than 50k as an hourly employee lol am I getting shafted? I can’t afford bills without overtime
11czods,ja6mctm,3,What level of govt are you working at? I'm graduating with a Masters in Public Policy and looking to go into data analysis if possible. Currently a finalist for a PMF and looking at federal jobs at the GS-9/GS-11 level. Wondering if it's possible to work in data as a fed with an MPP given how strict they are with education requirements.
11czods,jaaacap,2,"Non technical skills are super important, and using a combination of those and technical skills to drive business value is key as many other have said. From a technical aspect (although I think you’ve got that covered), here’s a tool a YouTuber I watch has built to analyze data positions by their skills, salary, etc. Super cool  project.

11dnewt,jaa716z,2,Thank you
11dl3y8,ja9znge,1,"Draining - it’s not very draining for me. I enjoy the work. I think I felt more drained when I was working in marketing, but that career was not a good fit for me. 

Tedious - it can be at times. Finding the right data set. Understanding what everything represents and how all the data is collected. Cleaning the data. Documenting your work. 

Who the field is not for - if you need a lot of handholding. If you don’t like solving problems. If you don’t ask a lot of questions and you don’t like people asking you a lot of questions. If you don’t like vague projects. 

Who would find this enjoyable - people who are very literal or analytical. If you’re someone who often overthinks things. If you like to dig into problems and figure out how to solve them without someone guiding you. If you like numbers and clear answers (versus subjective solutions). If you’re comfortable with math. If you enjoy continuously learning and taking on new challenges. If you’re not intimidated by learning new software or technology. If you love creating a new spreadsheet even for personal stuff (budgets, vacation planning, etc). If you’re comfortable teaching yourself (or watching videos/following tutorials) to learn things."
11djrjm,ja94cl9,4,"Have you done any projects yet? Are they summarized on your resume with a link to your GitHub? 

How much time are you spending networking? 

I pretty much never recommend getting a masters degree before getting some experience. You risk investing a lot of time and money in a field you don’t even know if you’ll like. Plus you’ll still lack experience and struggle to land a job, but with additional tuition debt."
11djrjm,ja92l0h,2,"Even though I don't have great experience and I myself am in a similar situation, I can say something with confidence. Don't wait to get noticed or hope a recruiter will notice you, you need to be a bit more aggressive. If you really like a role and you think you qualify, make sure to alter your resume based on the job description, contact the hiring manager if possible and show your interest. 

I unfortunately couldn't handle the stress of being unemployed and waiting for an entry data analyst job so I took an offer for a bank teller role. The plan is to figure out what to study next and hopefully find a role around data within the bank in the future."

11denqp,ja9p702,3,"Maven Analytics, datacamp, Kaggle have a plethora of datasets that you can use to create projects, as well courses to expand your knowledge. Maven courses are not free, however, their dataset collection is, and they provide a  nice portfolio site as well. Datacamp is not free, and Kaggle datasets are free. I don't know about courses. If I were to start anew, I would complete Alex the Analyst ""bootcamp"" on youtube, and then start doing projects."
11denqp,ja9i2e0,3,Alex the Analyst on YouTube. He's awesome
11denqp,ja8oo6a,2,Now I am doing some Excel projects but now I am looking some database projects.
11denqp,ja8mwij,1,"Try Maven Analytics,  they're pretty good"
11denqp,jaahy30,1,"I just started Career Foundry bootcamp and am also going into a new field. I recommend it because you get mentorship, they help you land a job, they have over 95% success rate, it gives you structure, motivates you because it's payed, but the price is a fraction of what other bootcamp cost, I really recommend it. Plus, there's a money back guarantee if you somehow don't get a job after completion.

I started as people here said with YouTube videos and free websites, but I found myself stuck on what to do next, there was no structure. And that's coming from someone who is very organized and does not procrastinate. I would say 99% of people going into this field should take a DA Bootcamp."

11czfno,ja5wwgg,13,"You don’t need Python for data analysis. SQL, a data viz tool, and sometimes Excel are good enough for the majority of roles, however Python is nice to learn because you can do more “data sciency” things like machine learning, regression analysis, and orchestrating data pipelines."
11czfno,ja6rzop,3,"Not even close to mandatory.  In fact, I would argue that most of your focus should be on SQL and a visualization/reporting tool (e.g. Tableau, Power BI) BEFORE even bothering with Python.

On my last data analyst position, of 45 data analyst, less than 10% knew python to any level of proficiency.  However MOST of them were great at SQL and MANY of them were good with Tableau /Power BI.

Pushing Python as a required skill for data analysts is just a method for folks selling courses to try to differentiate their programs from everyone else."
11czfno,ja66v9p,2,"For some data analyst jobs, Python is mandatory. For others, it isn’t. 

Learning Python will open more doors, so why not learn it?"
11czfno,ja5vwwt,2,I am looking for a good job if someone need any freelancer to complete projects in excel so contact me I will help you...
11czfno,ja6hilz,1,Python is just a tool. Its better to have a few powerful one in your tool belt but is not necessary
11czfno,ja714qc,1,"Definitely not. Depends entirely on tech stack of your employer. In my experience, most organisations are 5-10 years behind the cutting edge"
11czfno,ja751c0,1,You should also know how to solve problems with data. But yes for sure Excel is all thats needed at entry level
11czfno,ja7l8lj,1,Mandatory: no. But if you really want to be a good data analyst you must learn.
11czfno,ja83vz2,1,Even if not mandatory you should pick up the basics and learn some scripting. Most of the Python I use isn’t compulsory but saves a shit ton of time to automate tasks.
11d3me6,ja7p6pa,1,"For your bachelors degree, also list the name of the university and the dates attended. 

For your current job, list the start date (month year). For your other jobs, also add the months to the start and end years. 

For all jobs, add more outcomes. You did this in the last bullet of your current job, but try to add this for all of your bullet points. Don’t focus on the tasks but the impact on the business. 

Also since you have experience, I would reorder your sections to list Experience first, then Education (with your bachelors degree at the top of the list), then skills. 

The dates for your second and third jobs overlap - were these part-time? That might be confusing. 

Also you have 4 years of experience - why are you going for entry level jobs?"

11d8v8h,ja7c4ei,3,"Do you have any opportunities to do data analysis in your currenr PT role? It’s easier to move if you can show that you’ve done analysis for your employer and talk about the results.  

In terms of studying, I’d start with Excel, SQL and maybe tableau or powerBI. Also when searching for roles don’t just look for data analyst, you could also look at finance analyst, BI, MI and other data roles."

11cue5y,ja6oeqb,2,Just follows the CI. Either it will Look good or the Person in charge will like it.
11cue5y,ja6ymta,2,As the other's noted: follow the corporate design if there is one. For my own projects I like to use color pallettes from online sources (e.g. coolors.co). Play around with different pallettes to find a mix that you find pleasing to the eye

11csecd,ja55rav,7,"Experience and a portfolio of work are very valuable. ""How can I get either if I don't have a job?"" you might say?

Are there any local businesses that you might offer to do some data analysis for them in exchange for the experience? Analyze their sales or marketing efforts or customers or anything of that nature?

Are there any publicly available datasets you could analyze and publish the results? Tourism? Housing? Healthcare? Transportation? Education?

Another pathway that many people follow (myself included!) is to get a NON data analysis job with a company, and then start to understand what challenges that department or company is facing, and start analyzing the data and sharing insights with your team or manager. Understanding the business context behind the analysis is invaluable, and you can really generate a reputation as ""the guy that's really good with the numbers"" even if the department or company didn't originally have the budget to hire someone to do that analysis full time, you can make that skill so valuable that they FIND the budget to do so."

11d0ekq,ja72t6t,1,Use SSIS.
11d0ekq,ja7z5oy,1,I would use python and store the data in sqlite. You can execute SQL statements against the sqlite database. You can interface using python to execute the statements or you can use a tool like dbeaver which is a gui so it may be a little more approachable.
11cirpo,ja371pc,102,That sounds like straight up scam
11cirpo,ja37lwj,40,No no no. Definitely no
11cirpo,ja37yhf,41,"There’s a very high chance that their “guarantee” will be getting you a job for $10 a hour using excel for a local business and forcing you to pay $8,500 when you fight them on that.

If you’re going to spend that much money at least do it by taking classes at a community college or college"
11cirpo,ja3elzg,10,"What exactly do you mean by “help people land data analyst jobs”? What are the actual services they offering ? Do they teach you data analysis, coach you about application or interviewing process, write you a new resume, fill applications for you, place you with partnering employers - or a combination of things I listed? 

For example, if a company in question is a bootcamp with post-completion placement, I can see why it might cost 8.5k. If that is a resume writing / interviewing coaching kind of business, 8.5k is unreasonably high price tag."
11cirpo,ja3pxiz,8,Don’t go anywhere near this company.
11cirpo,ja3flmr,18,"Absolutely do not do this. Please. If you spend any money, spend around 100-500 on resources and online classes to bolster your resume."
11cirpo,ja3uycm,5,"NO.  Absolutely NOT.  Even if they get you a job, it could be quite a miserable one so they fulfill the contract. Avoid like plague."
11cirpo,ja3oirc,10,"A good recruiter will take payment from the company not you. That hurts your salary but it happens. If they want your money, it's 100% a scam. If they want payment up front then it's 120% a scam."
11cirpo,ja3805a,6,"That’s similar to a lot of boot camps here in the US. You go through their training and will only repay them your tuition once you’ve found a job.

There are even stipulations that the job must pay at least ~$50k a year in order for it to count. 

I’m not an advocate for these boot camps. Just stating the facts since I once explored this route. 

As for whether or not you should do it, do a cost benefit analysis and make a decision based on your tolerance and the conditions of the company."

Basically saying over and over that she does it out of good heart, while the goal was always to gather as much audience and then start selling courses. This is the first red flag, I just wouldn't trust a proven liar.

And the course itself.. a lot of the program is based on recycled free content.

I haven't done this program, but based on the information available, I would never sign up for this."
11cop1o,ja4e592,2,"I don't know about this program in particular but I do relate with you in a lot of areas. I too, recently graduated with my bachelors in biomed. I took stats course, one computer course and a research course where I analyzed data in my major.

 Regarding DA, mostly people start with Google's data analytics certificate but like you mentioned, it won't be sufficient. As someone already mentioned, Alex recently made a free bootcamp. I guess that can be a really good start (although I personally haven't done that) . Go for simple stuff in the beginning. Later you can go on to master individual topics by taking individual courses and once ready, do projects (as many as you can). I personally find courses on Udemy really amazing and when they have discounts, the price drops down by 85% and if you don't feel satisfied, you got 30 days to get a refund. Honestly it's not the course that will take you long but your curiosity to learn. Consistency is the key... Good luck!"

11cop1o,ja4q6i8,2,"I took her program, it is much better than the Google certification. I am still trying to find a job (3 months after getting her certificate, 10 months after my college graduation (bachelor's of science, engineering)).

If I were starting over from where you are I'd do her course then watch ""how to get into data analysis"" YouTube videos. It is really nice to have her community on discord so that's why I'd recommend it first."

One thing that happens sometimes is that sponsors and vendors attending the conference get free tickets they can give out to existing or potential customers (""Hey, just for you, a $4,300 value - and it's in Orlando!"").  I've gotten tickets that way before and been offered more that I wasn't interested in attending.  I don't know if that is the case with this Gartner conference, but you might look at the sponsors and vendors if there are more than Gartner, see if some service your company or might, and see if they have complimentary tickets.

Well that's shit.

And how am I supposed to do THAT?

But seriously, I'm an analyst and system manager for Workforce Management data/systems in a medium call center. So a lot of forecasting contact volume, planning staffing needs, working with external teams to link systems/fix links, and maintaining system setup. The following are everyday things for me

(1) a lot of finding and cleaning of data. (2) a lot of data management and automation. (3) a lot of translating needs to requirements and results to stories. (4) putting out small fires. (5) learning, panicking, revolving back to ""wait no I'm fucking awesome."""

Then we get special requests from other departments that are added to that list and assigned to an analyst. Then we have a big “for fun” project with one due date and each report in this project is assigned to an analyst. 

So each day starts with the analysts seeing what’s on their plate for the day and then they start sifting through excel sheets, joining them, analyzing, submitting for review, then uploading where it belongs. 

My particular tasks are shadowing coworkers and having them walk me through the steps and editing and formatting the reports on the “fun project.”"
11bksbj,j9zapb5,7,"I'm not a Data Analyst but a Senior Business Analyst, so my focus is slightly different. At my current eCommerce company we are going through a platform transformation including our data warehouse. Within the data area part of our focus is looking at our existing structure, systems, and processes to see if/where we want to modify how we store, classify, or transform our data. I've taken the initiative to help drive our transformation to our new infrastructure (Snowflake) and been working on tickets to help get us there faster (rewriting SQL queries, designing new data models, understanding how other systems within the company will be transformed and how that will effect how we ingest and handle the data.)

Currently I'm working on a ticket to understand and identify ways to improve how we identify and manage ""Bot"" traffic, i.e. any traffic that is unlike a normal human browsing our website. This could include common web crawlers, abnormal traffic from individuals scraping or sending junk requests to us, botnets, etc. This is important because in our line of work, one of the ways we make money is by charging for every click on our website (CPC model) that someone makes to a partner shop. So we (and our partners who pay us for the clicks) are interested in ensuring the traffic they get are from legitimate humans with spending money, among other reasons.  


Unfortunately, less than a handful of people at our company know exactly how the existing bot management system works because the people that wrote the java code left long ago, and although there is documentation, it may not be 100% up to date.  


So I am taking current web session data, reviewing documentation, and combing through the relevant java code as well as talking to the data warehouse team who technically owns the management of that code, to understand and recreate the existing bot detection rules on session data in tableau, getting as close to 100% correct classification with respect to the current system as I can to ensure I understand it. After which I will be analyzing the data to see if there are other patterns of behavior or details about the web sessions themselves that will help us filter out any additional remaining abnormal traffic.

In the end I'll better document the current system, recommend additional criteria for creating a new bot management system (this will become at least another ticket for the data warehouse team to implement in our future infrastructure), and need to coordinate with our B2B team to ensure they understand how we classify bot traffic so they can determine the best way to consume that data to determine which clicks to invalidate, which will also involve coordination with finance so they know which clicks to invoice.

Much of my time lately has been spent heads down working on this ticket, but there are also meetings to help coordinate on other aspects of the transformation,  internal stakeholder requests, or working on brainstorming, experimenting, and gathering insights on other potentials ways to increase revenue, reduce cost, optimize systems, etc."
11bksbj,j9yt9n3,5,"I try to explain that the data is the data and whatever hunches or feelings you may have, again the data is the data. If you don’t like the data that is fine but don’t disregard the data and expect a different result if you do the same crap over and over. 

Also, I have to explain my rationale to people who have no idea what they are talking about because some sales executives didn’t like that they are not performing well so the data is the problem."
11bksbj,j9yggcb,7,"People calling everything data...
People asking for or handing you things that you can't actually use or do because it's not consistent and doesn't follow database principles...

2.) Meetings - Meet with stakeholders to automate reporting

3.) Work on the project to develop report dashboards.  This means hunting data sources, understanding the structure, cleaning, transforming data
4.) work with users for data visualizations

> * The course says it takes 240 hours to complete. I think it could be done in 80 to 100 hours while watching all the videos in each course, doing the learning logs, practice problems, and capstone. If you are a college student on break, just bite the bullet and knock it out in 2 to 3 weeks. If you are a full-time professional, put in 10 hours a week and knock it out in 2 months.

I have a full-time job and did it in 7 weeks.

11c8ojt,ja2vz7o,1,"Industrial engineer here, but it's been many years, so I'm going off of memory, but you can just google it or find a book on SPC.  You basically create a line chart with upper and lower control limits (basically 2 horizontal lines) defined by some statistics like plus/minus 2 sigma or whatever.  When you have a measurement that falls outside the limits, then you have an out of control process.  There is difficulty in trying to make this real time.  There is over the shelf software that companies can purchase or have someone write custom code where an alert is sent or the machinery is even shut off as soon as a measurement is outside those limits."
11c8ojt,ja765vh,1,"The real difficulty is picking your control limits. I think most guidance will tell you to use 3 standard deviations as a starting point and then tightening or loosening them from there. You have to work closely with process owners on this to determine what level of control they’re really looking for. It may be the sort of thing where you start with 3σ and the process owner is okay with one measurement outside of that, which means your control limit is somewhere above 3σ. On the other hand, I work with one mission critical process that is usually very tightly controlled anyway, and we use 3 standard errors instead of 3σ, and if we go outside that, we’re taking corrective actions. Going outside 3σ with that process means the wheels have fallen off a while ago."

11b9egh,j9x60lw,7,"I had a boss years ago who would reject candidates because she thought they’d be bored. She was probably right - in reality, the job was a lot more boring than what was described in the job description and interview. She sold it as what she *wanted* the job to be, but the reality was lot less advanced."
11b9egh,j9y141i,4,"Yep. The candidate went through a data science boot camp and kept talking about being a data scientist or using this role to transition into a data scientist.

The interview was for a business analyst position. We did have data science teams but we're not hiring this person to see them leave or be generally unhappy and disengaged with the projects we need them to do only to start over in 12 months when they leave.

It takes anywhere from 4-12 (or more!) weeks to hire someone. We have to write the business case, get budget approval, screen resumes, schedule interviews, then wait for the candidate start date. Resume screening onward might repeat for a few cycles since candidates might use our offer as leverage for other offers or background checks might not clear HR. That's more time that our business suffers (increased workload/stress, drop in client satisfaction, decreased output for business, etc.)."
11b9egh,j9wzznx,5,"I had this same feedback given to me after nailing a final round where basically they said I'd be bored. At first, I was like wtf but I just got another job at a better company that had a faster pace.

I think flight risk is a real concern because you don't want to invest a ton of time into a someone, have them own a lot of critical things and then bounce because they're unhappy. If there's no room for you to fly you'll just spread your wings somewhere else.

Anyway, sounds like it wasn't a good fit and best to just move on in the pipeline"
11b9egh,j9wzm2s,6,"You probably said some things during the interview that made it seem like a very one-sided interview. 

Did they ask you what your goals are, and did you answer with anything other than what is related to the job? 
Did they ask you where you see yourself in 5yrs and you answered anything other than the current role?
Do you have a history of job hopping very often? 

You have to be tactful in interviews and act like you actually want the current position and to grow within it, when in reality most of us (me included) are planning to jump ship when something better comes along."
11b9egh,j9xuf72,2,"Ive experienced something similar so I think it’s not uncommon. I’ve been told I absolutely nailed every interview, asked for feedback and it was all positive all the time, except they thought I’d be bored and I guess my ambition shined through in my answers and questions. They literally told me they were concerned I’d find something else and move on quickly when they wanted someone for at least two years. I think this can be a sign that you should be aiming higher or at different companies where that kind of ambition is valued. at the time, it stung that they essentially told me I was an excellent candidate and then proceeded to reject me."
11b9egh,j9x5pp5,2,"If they don’t want an ambitious candidate, they should say so and not try to trick you into revealing your goals. I’d say you dodged a bullet with employer. Feel free to give both the employer and the recruiter some feedback on how unfair and unethical this trickery is."
11b9egh,ja3qhum,1,"The reason is the cost in lost productivity while the job is open after the recent hire leaves, the cost to recruit a new hire which includes all the time lost from managers and team mates that need to interview the candidates, the possible loss of trade secrets, the idea that much of the time the recent hire would be there involves training them which will need to be repeated soon and both times takes up the productivity of other team members, and more.  It quickly adds up to where it doesn't make sense from the employer's side to hire someone that they don't think will be satisfied with the job."

Excel is definitely nice, and you can really be extra good at the job/set yourself apart with some SQL knowledge.

This is not a corporate job but a warehouse job, hence why it has the ""lift up to 49 pounds"" basic qualification. Additionally, this is not an ""L4"" (entry-level corporate) role but a ""Tier 3"" role which is a warehouse level designation. This role is not salaried and pays similar to the other Tier 3 associates in the building. As an ICQA Data Analyst you are responsible for all things analysis for the warehouse this role is hiring for. 

It is an incredible foot-in-the-door role and I've seen a lot of warehouse associates do this for a year or two then move into corporate with all the SQL/AWS experience gained in the role.

That being said, trying to communicate that type of work is difficult. I think ERD's can be helpful to communicate the scope and complexity of the work you've done. While sometimes frowned upon UML type diagrams can be useful to communicate the general architecture and complexity involved.

Your best bet is to look for something in office, local to where you live, within the domain that you have experience in. The applicant pool will be much smaller. 

Your portfolio needs to be high quality - projects that solve real problems with data you collected and combined from various corners of the web.

Your resume needs to be annoyingly perfect. Your cover letters need to be personalized. 

The Google course is a good *overview* of the job but it’s not going to teach you nearly enough to actually land an entry level job. 

Don’t mean to discourage you, just want you to be aware of what you’re getting into since the YouTube videos out there that basically say “Google course + SQL + Tableau + Python + Portfolio = Junior Data Analyst job at $80k/year” are outdated at best and disingenuous at worst. 

It’s a HIGHLY competitive technical field. Once you finally do land an interview, you’ll be subject to several rounds. Plenty of opportunities to fall out of the race and go back to square one.

If you think that is the concern, then move your educational section to the bottom of the resume (that is how I have it).  Most recruiters/managers will scan the resume quickly and you can hook them with:

\- A brief description.

\- Skills

\- Certifications

Follow this up with your job description and then education section.

119ozmi,j9ohzay,3,"A few things:
1) End users / consumers / customers think their ideas are simple to implement
2) a lot of data inconsistency
3) poor data management (this is my biggest hurdle) - i frequently want to pull information on contacts - how many calls, what positions are calling in, and what are they calling about / what was done. # calls and who called is kept in a call record, whereas troubleshooting/documentation of the issue is in an INC record. I'm not allowed access to the data tables, and the relationship key is only accessible there.

Also, much as it hurts to say this, Excel can't do everything. Yet, anyway."

I don't want to pressure you to reveal your salary to me if you're not comfortable, just wanted to let you know because I feel like having open discussions about salary benefits us all.""

Don't listen to the comments saying she probably already knows or that you shouldn't tell her anything  - she probably doesn't know, studies have shown women tend to undervalue themselves in the workplace and lean towards being agreeable rather than negotiating their salary or pointing out their accomplishments. It's definitely the right thing to do to drop some hints and let her do with that information as she will. I wish someone had done that for me in my career."

Depends where you are in the world ... In Sweden everyone has access to anyone's salary information but I'm guessing you're based in USA. Also not sure of local law. 

Do you have any team building activities, or yearly inclusion and diversity workshops?  Is your team tight, in a good working relationship? You could bring up pay gap as a topic in an organic way - perhaps it's something that's been discussed with your female family members etc. See if others male colleagues are open to discuss it and perhaps share the salary brackets they're each in? Or everyone write down their salary in 2021 on a piece of paper anonymously? 

I'm thinking about doing it somehow in the open without making it personal?"
11950c2,j9mxxi5,-12,"A person's pay is between them and the employer. She accepted the offer letter and agreed to work for a predetermined salary. There could be many reasons for the discrepancy. 

Now if you tell her and she goes to her boss and demands a raise he could say no and she points to discovering your evidence, even if she doesn't give your name everybody knows what information everybody else has and they will know it was you.
One step further now her boss is anticipating her leaving and could limit her opportunities because why invest in somebody if they're going to leave? Like everybody else if she thinks she's worth more she can ask but the amount is based off the market so she could apply for other jobs elsewhere that pay more and then bring that to employer.

Again, I'm not saying she shouldn't make more but that's not for you to be apart of or determine."

11950c2,j9onjis,0,"Three things you can do. A fourth option is to do nothing.

- You can tell her about your salary - talking about your own salary is protected speech. Leaking your coworkers is not (without their consent).

- you can report the company for pay discrimination to your local authorities. Look into whistleblower protection laws.

- you can leak the information and tell her she should ask for a raise based on her merits. Depending on outcome, she can report the company herself. If she wins, she would get back pay for however long she’s been underpaid

I’d say talking to her is the best avenue for you, because there may be things she negotiated in lieu of salary that you may not know about that may not be reflected in the salary amount alone (flex work arrangements, additional time off). Occasionally, lower pay alone is not the result of discrimination. Odds are that it is unequal treatment based on gender, though."
119ruly,j9o0oq2,6,"My first thought when faced with any new job is how do I automate this. 

My first role (many years ago) was analysing HR performance (absence, turnover, pay, etc…). The nice person who did the job before me would work full time on this. I taught myself VBA and automated 90% of this within a few weeks — freed up a load of time to truly analyse the data and make myself available to do other things for the organisation. I told my manager at the time and that pretty much launched my career. 

The key to analytics (in the context of your question) is to automate the drudge as much as possible and spend your time finding and presenting insights that can change a business."
119ruly,j9q3fbk,2,"If you are spinning reports in excel, your vision is spot on.  Think of automating the process using power query and then stand up powerbi dashboards with scheduled refresh.  Gradually, you can introduce some intelligence to reports like Time series or bring in python code. 

You have a fantastic role with a lot of scope to do transformational things.  My first role was like yours and I truly enjoyed it.  All the best"

11957d2,j9mx8t4,3,"I'm still learning about ADHD and not sure if I have it or not, but my impression is that it generally means there are various executive functions that you tend to struggle with and you may have difficulty with some executive functions but not others. 

I personally struggle with initiating tasks, emotional regulation, possibly planning, and possibly time management. So for example, as an analyst coming up with my own project ideas that are on a topic I'm not super keen on is near impossible (hard to initiate unless I'm obsessed with the topic). Some roles may have you do that. My work now is typically dictated by other people though, so i don't encounter any conflict with that particular executive function. But you'll have to know yourself well enough to understand the conditions you need to thrive.

I guess I should also note that i work remotely, and it is a STRUGGLE to stay on task at home. I suspect that some with even more difficulty with distractions may just completely fail to do their job while work from home. I'm managing right now, despite the difficulty, but it's because I am lucky enough to have a role that's relatively boring and less demanding. (Although, i also think that a more challenging role with more deadlines would help me focus to some extent - obviously there's a balance to strike and not all managers or offices will care about that). So just be mindful of how you work best. That would be my advice."

I don't think you need to buy a course. There are plenty of free videos on YouTube and good sites like [https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp](http://w3schools).

118lc13,j9ifezg,11,Honestly just be comfortable with syntax. You will always need to do something you haven't done before. Most people min tech are just good at quickly learning and extending their foundation. Most the type a vlookup and pivot tables impresses people. I prefer gsheets for the query function alone lol but I would worry to much. Focus more on sql and python pandas and stats tools excel will feel easy.
118lc13,j9iu2o1,8,"I prefer to think of analytics as research + presentation skills.  You might already know all of this, but being a data analyst entails management asking you for information about something, you dig up that information, be it from someone who has that information or from a database.  You then do some light statistics to aggregate the data, eg finding the average age of consumers, then report your findings.  Presenting is a lot of plots usually.  Management loves plots.  So you could play around with plotting data in Excel / Google Sheets.  But sometimes management has a simple question and a simple answer is all that is needed.

>it seems most junior level positions ask for experience with these.

It sounds like you analyzed the situation and figured this out on your own.  If so congrats, that's the kind of skill necessary to excel at being a data analyst.  That and having communication skills goes a long way too.

To directly answer your question, Excel has its own programming language you'll want to learn.  You can take an Excel class, which imo is probably the best way to learn the topic because a class will give you example data so you can do semi real world projects.  Most local junior colleges offer such a class, usually a 1 unit night class, so quite easy to learn.  There are online classes too, many for free.

The same goes for SQL.  If you can find a class, it will have a database  setup with data already you can log into with semi real world data which helps.  An SQL class is going to be a 1 unit easy class too.

If you want to learn Python, most colleges and universities teach it as their CS 101 class, which has a bit more going on.  Learning to program is learning how to automate work, which is super helpful for any white collar job.  I highly recommend putting it on your eventual bucket list.

I'm a data scientist so I'm guessing data analysts use Python the same way, but it can be super helpful to learn notebooks, eg Jupiter Lab.  It's super easy to learn, and it makes creating presentations super easy.  You can write paragraphs and plot directly into a notebook making a notebook kind of similar to a research paper in how it looks.  You can present in depth findings that way.  This can be a fun 102 topic for later.

Good luck!"

118pwy6,j9iuiyz,5,"

I've been seeing data analysis roles lately start to require Python and occasionally R, for that reason it may be advantageous to learn a programming language properly from the beginning. This will not only help you in data analysis but also if you want to pivot into data science in the future.  Tools like Databricks are more powerful if you can code, learning analysis tools like DAX and SQL are easier if you know how to code another language. 

I enjoy data analysis and have been doing it for almost 15 years but starting again today I'd consider leaning towards software engineering. Data analysis involves more and more coding every year, and this trend is not likely to change. Also Having software engineering skills will be nearly always be helpful as an analyst and let you automate a lot but are critical if you wanted to pivot into data science down the road.

Pay for software Devs is higher, there are more contracting roles if you want flexibility.

Stress in my experience is workplace specific, and depends a lot on your boss and the management above them.  Ultimately being good at your job is less stressful so if you think you'd be better at one or the other then the one you're best at will be less stressful."

However I would say 90% of my python usage is data transformation, ie read in large datasets, remove columns I don't want, create computed columns, joining with other datasets, filtering datasets, changing column names, appending multiple datasets, summarizing datasets and then saving small summary tables that are easy to analyze in excel."

117f0fn,j9bbc8n,5,I believe this is the *exact* use case for which Tableau and PowerBI were invented.
117f0fn,j9blisl,1,Just pull the data you need and store it in your database. Connect that to tableau/power bi/etc.
117hm9p,j9dl0rr,2,I was hired as a data analyst because of my industry knowledge and my analytical work on projects and production. I stepped right in on some non coding projects and have been brushing up on coding. Communication is the skill you really need and it’s more important than coding. Getting information from the principles and communication of our analytics is the key mission not coding.
117hm9p,j9d9kqm,1,The tools will come and go but the process will be there for a long time. I would recommend learning how to work with stakeholders. Unfortunately this comes with experience. Create your own process from collecting requirements all the way to creating viz. Database fundamentals will be constant so learn that. Learn power bi and it's easier to learn tableau later. Learn SQL and python. Basically continue learning.
117hm9p,j9ft0n4,1,"I... know I am a huge snob about this, but I am ggplot2 all the way, and powerBI/tab if I have to publish. And I strongly encourage you to be a snob at it too.

What you will find about data visualization is how far for someone who can't draw can design products with coding software. And all of that comes down to... basically fucking up. And you need to fuck up all the goddamn time.  Viz is sooooo much fun when you start to learn to accept that you can go beyond the bounds of what is normally expected. ""From data to vis"" should be your bible when it comes to what you want charts to look like. But once you make a few(well more than few) projects just by goofing, you find that your projects will go from [this](https://r-graph-gallery.com/220-basic-ggplot2-histogram_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png), to [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Z3tt/TidyTuesday/main/plots/2022_36/2022_36_LEGO_bricks_sd.png). And some of this just can't be done through non-coding.

What I think that you should prioritize, however, is you should learn to play with visualization in many different ways. What you will find is that without some coding, you are limiting your scope to what the GUI can tell you to do."

117fiwu,j9g46q6,2,"I've just started looking for work so take my opinion for what it's worth. I think certificates/bookcamps are great resources but an end all be all. Even coursera you can basically complete it without learning a single thing (and free with financial aid to boot). 
What matters is what you can do afterwards like portfolio projects, so certificate completion or no at some point you have to show tangibly that you know what you're doing. [shameless self promotion](https://medium.com/@pauldbuono/wine-analysis-project-27ba65f13847)"

1170e56,j99kci8,2,"You want to use LTRIM instead of TRIM, otherwise it’ll mess up any IDs ending in 0, since it’ll remove the 0’s from both ends unless you use LTRIM. For example TRIM would turn 0034760 into 3476 instead of the desired 34760. 

So the join condition you’d want is:

LTRIM(‘0’, TableA.AccID) = TableB.AccID

The syntax may be different depending on the flavor of SQL you’re using (the one I listed is what it is for SQL Server and Postgres SQL). You’ll have to look up LTRIM syntax for the type of SQL you’re using if not one of these. If it doesn’t exist, you could use a substring function and look at the 3rd character going forward, you may have to do some casting to get the types to match if the AccID isn’t VARCHAR, so the joining would be on:

SUBSTRING(TableA.AccID, 3) = TableB.AccID

If they aren’t already VARCHAR type, you’ll need to do:

SUBSTRING(CAST(TableA.AccID AS VARCHAR), 3) = CAST(TableB.AccID AS VARCHAR)"

You can look at a table of world population data and say ""The world has 7 billion people - but that's not 'insight'. It's not answering a real question or solving a real problem.

Insight is the answer to a question or problem. 

An insight into the world population data might be ""by 2025 the world will have 9billion people"". But it might also be a step deeper. 

At what point will the world have too many people? Are there certain parts of the world that have too many people already? What will be the effect of those parts being overpopulated?

116scml,j98d431,11,"IMO a Master is always good in any discipline, best if you can do it while working full time, even if it takes a bit longer, because 2 years with no salary and paying tuition is a huge investment.

Moreover, some companies pay for it either fully or partially.

Good luck."
116scml,j98ywbg,7,"If you’re going to do a masters for data analysis, do stats

It will add more to your resume than these new data analytics/data science degrees, which can be a bit wishy washy"
116scml,j98xiax,6,"Having a master’s degree often makes me more competitive than other candidates in a tight job market, and it usually gets factored into salary negotiations. If your company is paying the majority of the cost, do yourself a favor and get a legit credential from a good institution. You’ll have a lot more to hang your hat on than the ‘I LeArNeD iT fOr FrEe’ crowd."

116mmmx,j97lkyk,7,I wouldn't take 30% cut. There has to be transferrable skills from one role to another. You're not starting fresh straight out of school...

116mmmx,j98x3kt,2,"I would say set a timeframe to do your best looking for the ""perfect""(Good salary, exciting position/company, benefits, etc) job, like 5 months perhaps, from there you could study a bit the patterns and see if realistically you could get hired with no prev experience as an analyst, in that period also save some money, if needed, so if you take a pay cut job the bills won't come and get you. Also, don't see a ""not ideal"" position as a dead end, take the less-salary job and continue looking, now your resume looks a bit more attractive because you have already some experience. We are also in this ""correcting/recession"" so most companies are somewhat assessing which direction they want to go.

Since this is such a small business I would focus on those things and stay away from CAC and customer life cycles and CVRs etc. which would be key metrics at larger companies"

that part, unfortunately.

a degree isn't a necessity but it's used as a proxy for multiple domains including: 

* competency
* maturity

w/o a degree,i generally tells folks to lean into their network as manipulating data is only part of the job. i'm assuming, but at 17, with no degree, there's not much of a professional network?

it's just going to be hard convincing people to listen to you/give you the time of day, though.

snooping through your profile reveals that you're on the **young** side of 17. have you worked a part time job before?

you're gonna get folks who question if you can even show up to work every day. like fundamental *my first job* type concerns on the level of ""do you have reliable transportation?""

you're gonna be at a big disadvantage unless you've got some kind of work history established and can get folks to vouch for you.

1143bbj,j8u9yz9,1,"At the simplest level, you’d extract a list of each opportunity you worked or message you sent from each tool, some attributes about each opportunity you wanted to compare (for example, subject line, day of the week the message was sent, job titles of the people targeted, etc), and some factual data about the opportunity - did you get a response, how long did it take, was the opportunity won or lost.

Any modern marketing or outreach tool can probably generate a CSV export of this sort of data for you if you poke around in advanced features, and you can then bring those into excel and stitch them together. They’re unlikely to export in the same format, so you can expect a fair amount of manipulation and formulas to coerce everything into a format where you can compare opportunities across platforms.

This all works fine for an exploratory or ad-hoc analysis - something you’re just doing once. That’s where Excel and google sheets shine. If you want to keep track of this over time and regularly re-evaluate your success across platforms - well, excel is not a database, as any crusty DB admin will tell you with a sneer.

At that point, you’re no longer talking about a simple exercise, and you need to think about more full fledged reporting solution - you need scheduled or event-driven processes to regularly extract data about new opportunities, keep track of them as they change status, transform the data, stitch it together, store it in a database, deal with duplicates, missing data, late-arriving data, etc. 

None of this is particularly simple or easy if you’re looking for an automated long-term solution, but it’s a classic marketing and outreach analytics problem. Modern marketing tools tend to have fully featured analytics platforms and A/B testing built in, but the data is siloed, and as you’ve found out, none of these in-platform analytics tools do you much good if you want to compare how well your LinkedIn outreach is doing compared to the emails you’re sending from your email platform or the brochures you’re handing out at a trade show.

Find job postings for positions you’d like in the future, and focus on gaining what skills you lack currently. 

Other than that, just stay present, stay curious, and take things a day at a time."
113tbpk,j8sgv13,2,"So what I would do at this point is think about what kinds of professional organizations and certs you would be looking at. For specific jobs, these certs can be valuable or completely useless. 

Some of these certs are requirements for careers. Often restricted by time in the job, not skill, which sucks. But even if you don't qualify, they are often a way to understand the language the career path wants you to know.

For example, in banking, you have the CPA and CFA as the most famous, but one requires an accounting degree, and the other does not. You should also consider there are a lot of other certifications that are more valuable to have that are less famous, but more necessary for the job, as that field as a lot and can open certain doors better.

 Tech really depends. You could do just data analyst work, but you can also have knowledge in help desk work. So A+ might be good in that direction. A lot of the data analyst/science certs.... really aren't that valuable if you don't have a project within the org to go with it. 

If you are in the field you want to be in or have a contact in that field, maybe ask to see what specialized certs are actually valuable. 

What I will say is figure out if you are going down the line of project/program manager work. I personally don't like this kind of work, but it's a needed field especially because some job if you stay long enough, want you to do management at some point. PMPs CAN be helpful in SOME sectors. Public values that stuff very highly and it's kind of a back door for some federal agencies if you don't have military experience.  The first job I had required it for me to go from GS12 to GS13, the second job never heard of it, the third just said an MBA is the only degree that would matter if I need to do that kind of work. 

Also I will say, if you make a move to those places, get an idea as to what jobs are there. Richmond is fed town for sure which means you will run into jobs that require clearance. I would say just make sure you are reading carefully especially if you like to do stuff with mapping. They are pretty clear about if the job is clearance or not, (they might not tell you how clearance it is, but let HR tell you that). Basically, if the job is a Big 4, some law firm, or anything to cyber security or media data mining, good chance it will require some clearance in the tech fields. [This is an example of one.](https://www.clearancejobs.com/jobs/7031172/senior-specialist-federal-data-engineer) It says ""Ability to obtain a U.S. Federal government security clearance within a reasonable period of time, which requires U.S.citizenship."" This basically code for, ""do you have it or do you know you will probably get it?"".

If you want those kinds of jobs, there's a long and kinda painful way to do that. It's often working for a non-clearance job at a fed HQ/region for a while, then ask your boss. Or be grandfathered as military.

113kjqp,j8rds3m,4,"Asking someone to clean a data set and provide insight in 24hours is a terrible timeframe.

113kjqp,j8ucy8w,3,"Yes, it’s common, but fortunately, far from universal. FWIW, I interviewed for a few companies that asked for that sort of thing last year, and they all had ridiculous expectations and insulting salary bands. I don’t even consider that sort of thing anymore.

All the attractive offers I got and the one I ended up taking were based on a combination of non-technical culture/problem solving/teamwork sort of interviews and (sometimes very arduous) technical interviews, but none of them asked me to do any homework.

Remember, interviews say a lot about a company - if they’re going to throw a dataset with no context at you and expect a slide deck the next day in an interview, it will only get worse as an employee. That will be your life every day if you work there.

You’ll occasionally end up in miserable time-crunch situations at even the best employer, but in general, an employer that respects your time and has realistic expectations of you as an interviewee is more likely to do so as an employee."

But no, not common. Rather the idea in most interviews I have had are, I am going to tease out to see if you know how messy data can be, and how would you make sense of that data. Generally, I would ask for a pseudo code, and what would be your process? You should know how to pseudo-code at your level, in can you explain where you would do something, change something, and give me an idea of what SQL you are using?"

Also the amount of time it takes to create a video answering questions like “what skills do I need for an entry level job” is much quicker and easier to create (and gets A LOT more views and engagement) than a video explaining or teaching those skills. I tried the latter (more quick tips than teaching a topic) and didn’t get as many views. I’ve been thinking of doing a longer video where I demonstrate working through a data analysis project, but just haven’t taken the time to create it in my free time. And I certainly can’t record myself doing my actual work.

113qoax,j8rpv4p,4,"I have worked in web development and I now work in Analytics. I feel like they are different disciplines with some transferable skills. 

The key question is whether you have any passion for data. Do you enjoy working with a big load of numbers? Do you want to understand why something is the way it is in your business? If you don’t, then analytics is something you should approach with caution. I love numbers and I love the process of drawing insight and truths out of a big jumble of data. But that’s not for everyone. 

When I did web development, I enjoyed the design aspect and thinking about the end user experience. The coding was fun as a puzzle to be solved but the UX was what drove me. I’ve been able to take that into the world of analytics and BI where I could design (hopefully) intuitive reports that look good as well as deliver insight. But you should love the numbers otherwise that’s a painful working day."

1. Who was this recruiter? Was this a recruiter that you were working with or are we... talking about handshake here? The former should tell you more about the job itself. The latter... well isn't really a recruiter. Sorry.

2. What kind of hours interfere with your goals? You are new at the job and likely quite young. You might have to devote at least some extra hours to learning your role or maybe to the job itself. For example, I work a standard 40 hours a week. Whereas an investment banker would probably work closer to 100.

3. You should probably talk to somebody from Amazon Reddit directly. Because it's one thing that Amazon offered a general role, to Amazon actually saying let's talk salary. 

4.65k isn't a lot of money. It's good money, but not a lot of money. This is important because money translates into what you are doing. It's weird for me, as someone who never worked at amazon, to offer 65k on a data analyst role. I worked 67k for a data research role.... for a state department, which pays on average 20% less than market value, usually less. 65k seems odd from amazon.

5. None of what you said shows me you know anything about data science. You probably do, but I have no idea WHAT that is.

111ifxu,j8g1a61,1,Dude I feel fucked if a PhD holder is applying for Analyst jobs.
111ifxu,j8glz89,1,"Imo the data analyst experience you mention is very generic, tells me zero about what you actually did. You should definitely go into more specifics for each of the bullet points you have there.  also you can take out the IT technician part and just expand the data analyst part."
111zhix,j8him8d,14,"If this was during the phone screening and you pitched yourself outside of their range/expectations, they'll probably just filter you out immediately - that is usually the aim of phone screenings.

It really boils down to what their expected salary range is. At the end of the day, there isn't much point at pitching yourself below what you would be happy with - then you just go through an interview process and end up trying to push up on a number you claimed you would be happy with earlier, which doesn't go well.

If they won't pay you what you need, and they don't get back to you, don't spend another second thinking about it."
111zhix,j8i0lfg,2,"I agree that there’s no point in giving them a lower number than what you’ll accept if they made an offer. But also always try to get them to give the range first. If you’d accept something in that range, reply “that sounds good.” If you wouldn’t, say “I’m targeting something closer to $x.” 

Also salaries are all over the place. I’m currently employed so I can be picky, but I’ve had recruiters reach out about mid to senior level DS roles that pay as low as $100k and roles that pay up to $230k. I tell companies all the time that their range is too low for me, because it is."
111zhix,j8ipryh,2,"It's an anecdotal example but I had to fill a form before interview and they negotiated with me after, asking if I would consider less pay."
111zhix,j8i5wvw,3,Why would you want to go somewhere that isn’t going to pay you your worth?
111zhix,j8kb3bn,1,"So first of all, there is a reason why you should ALWAYS KNOW your previous salary. ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS! Salary is sooooooooo much more than what they pay you. It means rank, it means status, its means what you can do. Worth is important sure, but it basically says to your boss, I am ""someone who works independently/intra/de"" I am skilled at ""excel/R/Python/Rust/uh C?"" I am (or NOT) ""a public speaker/ guy shy in the corner"" I do ""IoT work"" Knowing the worth of that is very important.

Going DOWN salary is usually a bad thing if you are going for a better position. Especially in the same state. Sure if you lived in NYC and are now in the state of Kansas, yes, you are going down in salary, but not overall worth.

A good example is in the federal world, if you go down a rank, the only real reason is that you are jumping to a different career. Accounting to law is a good example. You got tired to do GS-14 accounting ($110k in DC), just got your JD, now you are a GS-10($70isk at base, maybe some Steps to increase the salary) lawyer. OUCH, but only way you can get into that law degree. But because you made that salary decrease, even if you go back to accounting, you have to work back up to a GS-14 rank again. Alll the way from 10, and that probably take about at least 6 years to get back to 14.

The private sector is sometimes worse or better than the federal. I will say though, folks will question why you move down. This will be doubly worse if its a payment downgrade doing the same responsibilities. 

So please don't think you were paid too much unless you actually got WORSE at data science between now and then."
11174xj,j8d8t75,41,"For me, I spent years in your position. And there is no 1 way of resolving that.

Think of it this way... a lot of top chefs at the start of their career are just learning the techniques and can only put together basic recipes that are taught to them. Only after years and years can they then design not only recipes but full menus. There is no test or marginal point, it just happens over time through repetition and exposure to more and more projects (and critically, more experienced and competent analysts).

Right now, just get really good at what your doing and then go back to the basics of...

What does the data show? Does it show anything of value? If not, sometimes that is OK, and that is the only answer. That there is nothing significant to report. 

A simple trick/practice worked for me. Try creating a 1 page slide of your findings. This process forces you to distill all the data into a couple minutes of insight using only the most useful charts/tables/graphs. When creating this slide, always be thinking of a would-be viewer/recipient who is critically assessing you with a ""so what?"".

Sometimes when you feel like there is nothing to report on the data in isolation, consider how this compares to similar data sets (I'm thinking, as an example about marketing campaign results here).

I hope some of that may be of use.

P.S. I felt like a f***ing idiot/charlatan for years"
11174xj,j8dj2kr,16,Focus on business value. Where does your business need data the most right now? And how can you help good data flow to that place?
11174xj,j8doin9,5,"Once you get results, you need to be answering the question, ""So, what?""  What is meaningful about this for the business?  Why should they care?     
    
Talk to the businesses and find out what is helpful for them to run their business.  Find out what each business does and how.    
     
Eventually, this knowledge will help you shape the analysis as well to increase the probability of it being useful and actionable."
11174xj,j8eq7tc,6,"Sometimes insight is really simple, like yup you're getting more revenue if you're doing more sales. Track the volume of sales over time, is it steady, is fluctuating? Are you able to find 1 variable that seem to affect it?

11174xj,j8fw2fj,2,"I agree to those above, business value"
11174xj,j8ekp35,1,"What I have found is it's really helpful to have one or two narrow ""findings"" with some type of recommendation. Most requests for analysis come to me not very well defined, if at all possible I will spend as much time as I can get with the requester or stakeholders so they can begin to narrow the scope of the analysis. People will tend to be too broad at first, partly because they aren't data professionals and partly because it makes sense to cast a wide net if you're unsure of exactly what you want and think that you can get lots of answers in a single question. The problem is that while you could get a wide range of answers to possible questions you're never going to answer every possible question someone can think of while you're presenting findings and that shouldn't be your goal because it's hard to give accurate answers on the spot like that and it can take you down a lot of unintended rabbit holes. Additionally, if you're trying to cover every base it's extremely hard to give anything more than shallow, limited answers. 

TL;DR: I think there's a good chance what you're finding is actually fine, but you should work with the intended audience to make questions narrow and specific as possible. The collaboration will also make them more invested in the answers you find together and manage expectations."

10zwafm,j86311n,26,"First of all, everyone's got impostor syndrome. **Don't let it ruin your life or close a door prematurely.** Most people learn on the job, which it sounds like you're doing, but not everyone sticks it out and makes it to the other side. Those that do are the ones hungry to learn. 

I think the principal question here is are you interested and willing to learn? If you find the idea of doing analysis fun or exciting (independent of your own perception of yourself and ability to do it), then you CAN learn. The key here is to distinguish your feelings about the subject itself separate from your own perceived aptitude. You won't know if you're any good until you've tried your best.

It sounds like your coworkers think the joint efforts of you and your husband (who's effectively acting as your manager) are okay. You can make a learning plan to transition into someone more autonomous - try the project out yourself, use chatgpt-3 to unblock, and get your husband to review instead of heavily revise. 

If, however, the answer is that you dislike the work itself, then why try climbing a ladder that only leads to despair? Taking a pause, re-evaluating, and finding something more suitable may be better. You will walk away with the confidence knowing that you were able to talk your way into an opportunity. You'll do it again, but aimed at something better.

That being said, I'm concerned that you haven't picked up on the tools to do your job. Almost every job has significant downtime, especially with someone helping you. You're telling me you didn't have 4 hours to learn advanced excel functions on YouTube? You can buy an SQL course online and learn it in a week.

110f3rw,j89xl1c,2,"Quick definition, data clean rooms are a marketing term. It's where companies that offer lots of metrics about ad research, like Google, Facebook, etc, keep the data that gets fed to those buying ads in order.to understand the reach and potential of an ad campaign, results of past campaigns, etc. 

They are a big thing for marketing analysts, though they don't really understand they are interfacing with a data clean room. Any time you pull anonymized data from a large ad company like the above, you're pulling it from their clean room. The fact that it is anonymous data is what makes it ""clean"". 

Are you going to run into it a lot in industry, yes, but only tangentially as mentioned above. Building and maintaining one is more a factor for data engineering and data science, not analysts. And even then, only at companies where such ad/marketing data is generated on a large scale. If you don't have that scale, you don't have a market to sell the info, and this no reason to incur the overhead from a business standpoint.

Having said all that, while I've been in the DE side, I've never had to work on one, just heard a bit about them."

1103z38,j8943ca,6,"I'm going to be honest with you, this is a bad way to start a data analysis project. For a lot of reasons.

The biggest reason is that data is almost always within the management of a continuance or governance. This means that the data to solve your question has likely been answered already and is refined over and over again through the engineering of additional data, cleaning/wrangling, and blah blah. So if you don't have the data to begin with, the question you are asking may not actually be solved because there is no governance on your data. Especially when the data is of the interest of federal/state/local organizations. Your data SCREAMS department of transport, commerce, and justice, plus a litany of actuary organizations.

To put it bluntly, you got your priorities mixed up.  Start with a dataset that you think is cool (like car information in Ohio), do some very basic cleaning, THEN make questions from that.

Basically, your post should read, ""Hey I want to do some data analysis work on cars. Specifically, on actuary data, but I don't know what organizations collect the data I am looking for. Where would be the best place to look?"" Don't start with specifically, ""what cars"" ""how much did they cost"" demographies, because you might not know why, and you won't know why because some of that data is under clearance federally.

I would strongly suggest talking to your advisor/teacher/whoever because you don't even have the data behind your project. No sane professor will let you start a data analysis project without a dataset to work with, or fail to give you some kind of direction once you have established an interest."

You need to understand the problem your boss is trying to solve, figure out how to answer that problem with data and then propose next steps.

As for how you do that, my suggestion is to just have a doc structured. Make a quick and dirty write up - background, key takeaways, methodology and appendix w the technical details. You can provide a link to the dash if you like. 

Just remember they're not talking to the dashboard, they're taking to you. So you need to tell the story."

Thank you for the assignment and I am eager to present my findings. It would be very helpful to know what format I should use to present the data.

Tableau would be best for exploring my visualizations and data together. Tableau is not the best for exporting visualizations. 

RMarkdown would be a great option for creating a presentable document. 

The standard Excel spreadsheet will allow me to send you (simpler) visualizations but also include the raw data.

10zmvei,j84bwct,3,"1) Don’t re-invent the wheel. A paper form may be the best option if the people you need to collect data from are already familiar with it and can fold it up and stick it in their pocket and fill it out in the field. If you decide to digitize it you don’t need to develop an app or do anything with python. Collecting data from people in a form is an extremely common use case and there are tons of no-code products that work well - for example, Google Sheets or Survey Monkey.

2) This is way too vague a question. Is there an existing data warehouse you can store it in? If there isn’t, is setting one up your problem, or someone else’s? If it’s green field, what is your budget? What is the scale and complexity of the data you’re collecting?   Once you’ve stored this data, what will you do with it? How will users consume it and access it in an ideal world?

I’m not asking you to answer these questions for me, but they’re all things you need to ask yourself or someone in your organization. 

In general I wouldn’t expect a junior analyst to deal with data ingestion or warehousing. Hopefully you have some more experienced data practitioners on your team that you can work with on this stuff.

Last thought - do your best to resist the temptation early in your career to make your mark by building fancy, complicated, custom solutions for things. You don’t know enough yet, and businesses also don’t care: they just want it to work, and it’s almost always cheaper and faster to use a tool someone else has already built. The time and a place for a hand-rolled tool or solution to a problem is when you’ve tried everything that exists and nothing works. Until then, use what others have created because very few problems you’ll encounter are truly unique to you or your org."
10zmvei,j83zqj3,2,"Being farmers I'd guess some won't be very interested in online/app surveys. Heck, even city folk rarely engage with those. How many clients do you have? Sometimes literally interviewing them is the best form to have high engagement rates. Both your questions would probably be easier to answer if we had more information on the targetted demographics, how often you want to survey them, and number of clients."
10zmvei,j8403zh,4,"So I've stuck this question into ChatGPT and this is what we came up with together:

1) Create a microsoft forms that the reps will then support the farmers to add the link to their phones home screen, appearing as an 'app' to them

2) Connect relevant forms questions to our database to ensure incorrect data isn't submitted

3) Transfer the forms data to excel and beyond!"
10zmvei,j8a2hbc,1,A Microsoft based solution (eg Form) might be a good option. Used to work in this industry and farmers often operate in low signal areas so you might need a low tech solution that doesn't need to have a live connection to operate (asynchronous update could work too). It's also got to be simple AF as not all farmers are tech savvy

10zrsev,j84w3as,1,"t-test seems fine for this

I quite like doing visualisations for this to show distributions around the mean and whether they overlap

The question is what is the purpose in knowing this stuff?"
10zrsev,j84xqqr,1,"The categorizations for job position is a bit strange, since manual workers can be both employees and managers.

If you are planning on considering all of the categories (job position, age, sex) in your conclusion, I would not recommend doing using multiple independent t-tests without correcting for multiple comparisons. When you're pulling data from the same sample as you're increasing your family-wise error rate (i.e., the probability of a Type I error). Looking at your p-values here, I doubt an omnibus test will change your results significantly, but it would look better on paper.

If your Age is continuous, you could use something like a two-way ANCOVA test due to potential correlations with age and job position/seniority. My feeling is that there's probably also some form of a linear model you can potentially use, but I'm not well as versed in statistics as I'd like to be, so maybe someone else can comment on it (feel free to comment on anything I got wrong here as well)."
10zrsev,j85218m,1,"Thank you for your reply! I initially hesitated with an Anova test because of the problem of people potentially being represented in multiple categories, as you mentioned. Unfortunately I do not have the age of each manager, employee, etc, only the average salaries for specific age groups, which are in columns separate from the salaries particular positions. 

I therefore thought I may be playing it safe with separate t-tests. I will look into an omnibus test to compare the results. 

I agree that the categorization is strange, and i have not found more information about how it was collected.  

I therefore think part of this learning exercise will be judging the quality/ limitations of the data.

I appreciate your help!"

10yysxx,j80iz69,13,"Given that you have very little knowledge, it may be better to take this as a relationship building opportunity. You might even want to email someone in that team and ask more details/have an informational interview to ask about the role, the team, what data they own, who their stakeholders are, what skillset they need, etc. If you have the resources available, it would be important to learn the drivers for whatever data they are looking at. I think unless they are specifically looking for someone to own data for recruiting/HR processes or they are specifically looking to train someone with no experience from the ground up (maybe they have an all around bad experience hiring outside candidates due to weird tech/processes/bad pay?), the chances of you being a strong candidate will be slim.

Your header looks great. 

I would remove the summary. What I read most often is most things in summaries don’t mean much anymore. Additionally if you’re submitting a cover letter summaries are redundant.

You skills section looks amazing.

Experience section. Numbers! You have so many years of relevant experience but I do think without numbers a hiring manager cannot understand what you’ve accomplished. For example in the 3rd bullet point of “Some Whiskey Co.”. You might not know exactly what the less dead stock was and increased profits numbers were, but I think its okay to guesstimate to show what you accomplished. I would try to put numbers in 80% of your bullet points. Again though, you have a ton of relevant experience.

Same advice as experience, add numbers to the projects. “Used tableau to visualize over X million datapoints including; vaccinations, polulations, etc.” 

Drop the interests. It’ll give you more to room to share what you’ve accomplished in projects and work. To me it feels like Hiring Mangers, unfortunately, care about what you’ve accomplished not what you are interested in.

Then it’s time for a quick shower and breakfast before I leave for work around 9 ish. 

Okay, before any of you comes biting my ass, I’ll stop beating around the bush and come straight to the actual question. 

As a data analyst, the better part of my day is spent writing SQL queries fetching data from our database. 

We start our morning with the daily update meeting where everyone (currently the strength is 12, one co-founder and team leads) shares their agenda for the day, what they’ll be working on for that day. That’s the time we prioritise our tasks, discuss dependencies that a team member may have on any other other. 

These are the tools I use ordered in descending order of their usage:

- MySQL
- Metabase
- Google Spreadsheets
- Python (for data wrangling and exploration)

We use metabase as a dashboarding solution for our clients. It has visualisation and scheduling functionalities which serves the purpose. 

I use Python for internal analysis or doing a RCA. 

I get report requirements from all our teams. Some examples include: 

- carry out a RCA (from the tech team),
- creating sales or growth tracking reports (from product team)
- payout reports (from accounts team)

It’s an exciting or a tiring day based on how much progress I’ve made on the task I’m working on. 

It’s an exciting day when my queries work properly and my python code gives me the output I’m expecting to get to the root cause. Also, when I’ve had a good laugh with my favorite colleagues on stupid jokes and sarcastic comments during lunch. 

And it’s a bad day…well, you know when it’s a bad day. 

Also, I’m a low-spirited these days since one of our colleagues left. Our humour level matched, big time. 

Okay, I’ll stop over sharing. 

Bye!"
10yevo1,j7yfa9g,12,"I'm currently interviewing for a job that has branch offices in my city. During the first interview, I asked the interviewer if on-site was flexible due to medical issues I have that prevent me leaving the house sometimes, but not necessarily working, and his response was, ""I'm two states away, so long as you get things done, work at a coffee shop for all I care."" 

That being said, I've interviewed about three other places where the response was to end the interview when I said this. It really depends. If you want flexible or WFH, keep shopping around until you find it."

I support managers and sales teams all over the country so I’m doing a lot of remote collaboration anyway, and my boss is across the country from me. However it’s odd as most of the team that lives locally like me has gone to a hybrid type but I’m staying remote until my boss says something, which she won’t. I’m a one man analyst “team” so I don’t directly work with anyone consistently.

Obviously I would discuss moving states (US) first and not just do it."

However, I’m not free to just roam the world and log in and do work. We do have offices in other countries and I do occasionally travel to and work those offices. I think there’s a limit to the number of days I can work in another country though, for tax reasons. Also I’m not sure what would happen if I traveled to a country where we don’t have an office. 

With other companies (especially regulated industries), you’d get in trouble if you tried to access your company’s data while in another country."

In our organisation, data analysts tend to work on ad hoc and exploratory data analysis - answering specific business questions.

If regular reporting on something is required, the specifications are passed to the BI team. BI developers then work with data engineers to expose data directly to the business in a cube or dashboard for regular reporting.

But this is a fairly mature data team. 5+ years ago the whole analytics department was just a bunch of ‘data analysts’ who did everything with SQL and Excel. They spent 90% of their time preparing and emailing spreadsheets and CSVs that someone has decided is important enough to receive every month.

At the end of the day titles don’t matter, it’s more about whether your team spends their time producing stuff that has decision value to the business."

I have a few little thoughts for your consideration.

For your ‘Top_3_breeds’ data frame you manually stated each of the three breeds. A better approach would be to programmatically identify the top three breeds such as by sorting and then indexing just the top three. This way, you could use an updated dataset and even if the top three breeds change, your data frame will include the new top 3. The way you’ve done it would either be incorrect or you’d manually need to go in and update the code. Like an animal.

Also, for the plot of the three breeds over time, you didn’t need a legend as the titles clearly show what each plot is about.

You could generate a new variable / column that calculates the differences from the first year in the dataset to the last year. You could sort then plot this which would show the biggest increase through to biggest decrease.

You might then also want to pull out the top three into the same sort of plot you did over time.

Just some thoughts."

10x7fez,j7txvw7,2,"My experience is that a data analyst might mean something completely different in many different companies/industries/workplaces. Judging from job offers and my experience - sometimes Data Analyst is an excel only monkey, sometimes he might do a lot of reports/database work, sometimes he might be in a position to work on things like  programming in SQL (not only doing analytical stuff like selects etc but also writing loops etc) and sometimes, despite his title, he might be doing data science stuff in python. Sometimes it also happens to be just a different title for a Business Analyst, when you talk to people for 6 hours during your workday discussing business/it stuff. Depends. There is no standardization what so over when it comes to job titles. 

Read job offers and choose based on their descriptions. I started as an excel monkey so called analyst, jumped to reports dev and now I work as a BI/DB Dev."

10x3o36,j7qq804,10,"I work with data analysis on AWS on a small scale.

I'd assume if the position is for data analyst they would want you to have experience with those services. AWS has hundreds of services but for analytics it would be just a few - Athena, Quicksight, Kinesis, Redshift, and storage like S3. It really depends on what the company does with it, they could use one or two or ten services in various degrees of complexity. 

For AWS you could obtain the first basic certification they offer - Certified Cloud Practioner. It does not require previous cloud experience and is on an introductory level. Most courses that people use to study for it have hands-on exercises that teaches you to create a basic free-tier account and use the services that are part of that tier. That way you can get some experience. 

Another option is just to make yourself a free-tier account, carefully check what's part of that tier, and play around with it. You can upload some data to S3, perform ETL with Glue, query it with Athena and present it in a dashboard in Quicksight (it's very similar to Power BI)

Will it land you a job? Hard to say, if you already have some skills and education, it will be useful to get an entry-level job.

But if you have no prior skills, and no relevant education, IMO just this certificate is not enough.

10xle4f,j7v34a9,1,"It won't attract employers but will give you a solid understanding of the industry. The most valuable sections for me were interview practice and mock interviews and the case study. The case study section in particular gives a very clear example of what a project should look like.

The sections on the actual tools were just plain bad - particularly the SQL and Tableau sections. Lots of the datasets used in the practice are no longer available, the videos are completely out of order, and the explanations are incomplete and week. 

The section on R was slightly better but still pretty weak. As you'll quickly learn once you start applying, there's basically no demand for R skills. Everyone wants Python.

The Excel section was actually fine and informative but, being a Google course, everything is demonstrated in Sheets. The real world uses Excel. A lot of the processes and functions are actually completely different in Excel and the course does a very bad job of describing the differences.

All in all, you need it on your resume only because every other entry level candidate will have it on theirs. It's also the best high level explanation of the industry I've seen. But don't expect it to make recruiters flock to you."

Really, you don't need to fully prove anything, just showing the insanely high probability of cheating and letting the court of public opinion do the rest would take care of it...

They're likely doing their first play on the web and then doing a curated play once they already know the answer from the app or vice versa."
10wama1,j7rl1hp,1,"> However, what we have noticed is that, alongside her good scoring, she constantly seems to be getting really high quality first words, with several yellows and greens. The fact that she would be beating us is not an indication of cheating in itself - she could just be really clever. However, no matter how good you are, nobody could really be consistently better than anyone else on the first word. It would surely be impossible, as it’s totally random.

Could you define what would qualify as ""cheating""?

One problem in playing Wordle with friends is that some people always play with the same starting word. So if you see their Wordle grid posted before you play your own game, then you know that some letters are not going to be part of the hidden word, hence you automatically adjust your strategy accordingly. If Uncle Fred always starts with MAPLE and it gave him ⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️, then I probably won't use M, A, P, L, or E when I play.

I play in a group chat and we follow the rule of not starting with the same word every time. It adds an extra layer of challenge so rather than cycling a shortlist, I try to come up with a new first word every time I play."

10wfeie,j7oerpc,3,"no No NOOOOOOOOO. YOU DO NOT CHANGE SCALES ON LIKERTS. EVER. This is almost as bad as cleaning a number from 5.5 to a 6 or 5. This is data fraud if you do this.

Think of it this way. If I gave a 5 Likehart scale and then told the group that all Strong Disagrees are 2s instead of 1s, you would have folks that say ""Well actually I am a 1 not 2."" You would inherently be changing the goalposts, which I forget what survey error this is.

Likerts are fundamentally ordinal, so you can't assume that a strong agree 5 is the same as a strong agree 7. This is why it is VERY VERY BAD practice for a long survey to have a mix of 5s and 7s if they aren't on different subsets because you do have to separate your 5s surveys and 7 surveys into different scales. Always.

So, first, ask yourself WHY are there different scales because good surveys take a crap ton of time to get approved of. The reason almost always is either asking the same question in a different format, or this a new question subset. If that is the case, what will likely happen is that questions written for your scale might look like 1a 1b 3a 3b  and so forth. Whereas your 7s might be 2a 2b 4a 4b. 

Even if they are intermixed in the same subset, its ussually very predictable as when certain questions are asked. For example, on the Census ACS, 1a is ""What are the names of your family members?"" Nominal. 1(1/X)b Blank says he is paid fairly. 5 Likert Scale. 1(1/X)c Blank can pay (gender) bills? 7 Likert Scale.

If it's not predictable when the survey changes from 5 to 7, you still need to keep the 5s and 7s separate from each other.

If your final product is a visualization, folks will understand when you have two graphs for the results for the 5 scale stuff, and the 7 scale stuff."

10w1dw9,j7ldgj1,10,"Get rid of the table. Ditch the soft skills and operating systems section. Combine languages and software section and label as tools and delineate with commas. List services section as skills and delineate with commas. 

Shorten your bullets in work history. Use more quantifiable figures - even if you’re just estimating. Also, pay attention to your verb tense. Keep it all past tense. 

Fix your margins to get rid of the excessive white space. Also get rid of the white space in between sections. 

Once you do all of that, you should be close to a single page. You can probably adjust the formatting of your header to take up less space as well.

10vogmz,j7iy85g,13,"Depends on the company and role. Some roles are very client-facing and you would be regularly communicating your findings. Some roles analytics is a back-end role and the presentations are from another person or team in the company. 

I do business intelligence, which includes analytics and data visualizations so I do presentations often."
10vogmz,j7ilywp,12,I’m giving a public presentation of some kind several times a week. This is a normal part of being an analyst.
10vogmz,j7k1wpf,3,It’s often in DA life.. you need show your perspective and how you thought
10vogmz,j7j9dw8,2,"I work as a DS at a tech nonprofit, started as a data analyst. I do regularly present short decks (findings, proposed projects, stuff like that) to managers and my technical team but these are generally pretty low pressure, if they are bigger or more important I'll refine with my manager. As I've gotten more seniority it has become more common. I wouldn't necessarily say that being a data professional makes you need to give presentations especially often but the perception around being a ""data person"" may carry with it an expectation to wow people or think of questions no one else has if you don't manage it. 
I do spend a fair amount of time collecting and analyzing information to support other people's presentations though and often will be asked to sit in to help with clarification of needed. 
I'll occasionally give a webinar and last year I did a couple breakout sessions for a conference (very small and we hosted it), these were completely optional though."
10vogmz,j7jrj55,2,20% but I'd say that 20% is more important then anything else
10vogmz,j7k7bd9,2,"I think you already have the answers here but I will support what has already been said — it very much depends on the flavour of the role and the organisation itself. 

Through my career I have needed to do presentations, explain findings, etc… and they have become more as my career has progressed. However, a lot of those were relaxed ‘conversational’ presentations but the job usually demands presenting your analysis to a room at some point. 

I don’t enjoy public speaking and it is a ‘skill’ I have acquired through the job. Try not to let that hold you back if this is something you are truly passionate about."
10vogmz,j7t1n3c,2,Im doing presentations to an audience of 1-5 on a weekly basis. Rarely in any bigger groups as a sole presenter. I work remote though so it is basically cheating.
10vogmz,j7jhgbl,1,"Data analyst here. Not once have I had to give more than a 30 min presentation and even those were pretty low key/demoing a new report and answering questions. Fairly low key and pretty conversational. I'm sure if I were totally averse to presenting I could have skipped that part. I'm sure it exists, but a DA role heavy on presentations is going to be the minority. Most of your time will be spent working with data--if you have to present longer than you prepare something's off.

That said, every position is likely to be different. I'd be sure to feel it out during the interview process. If the hiring manager doesn't bring it up, I'd ask (at least probing questions) about it when they ask you for questions. I'm sure some managers will view this as a negative, but if your performance/reviews are going to suffer because you do not enjoy (or simply do not excel at) public speaking, and it is an expectation as part of the role, better to be passed on and find a better fitting role elsewhere."
10vogmz,j7jqp5w,1,"Depends. At my previous job I did A LOT of presentations: at department level, for SLT, for investors, for clients...

At my current job I don’t do presentations at all."
10vuzva,j7k41jg,2,"So I don't actually work in analytics, but I tried to. I teach statistics, and was already very tech savvy, so learning the basics wasn't a big jump for me. In my first real interview, though, I was asked something along the lines of ""tell us about a decision that was made from a report you created."" Now, I generate a good amount of data for my job, but in that moment I couldn't think of a specific thing that had ever changed (outside of my own classroom, by my own hand) based on data I'd generated. Later I thought heavily about it and came to the realization that a ton of data is generated and analyzed, but no real decisions are ever made based on it. I've seen this sentiment brought up here before.

Now I don't want to say it never happens. I'm sure some people/businesses are making decisions based on analytics. But... I think a lot of people don't actually know what to do with data, even when presented in an easily consumable way. From my own experience, statistics is REALLY HARD to understand for most people. They may understand relative things like ""this went up/down compared to past month,"" but I think trying to pin that to a specific cause or reason is difficult for them to conceptualize.

Sorry, this probably doesn't help you with how you're feeling. I guess you need to just focus on what you want out of your job: is it fulfilling? Is it causing you more stress than it's relieving (from money)? Do you get satisfaction from your work? Maybe moving to a bigger or smaller place could help, I dunno. I don't think this is specific to the field, though."
10vuzva,j7k9zip,1,"> \~70% of my time is spent validating/cleaning data, which I'm good at but \*greatly\* dislike. I dislike it because not only is it a very tedious and monotonous process...

not a DA/DS here, I am *just looking*, but from my research into the field, I've heard about this unglamorous part of the job.

> and it's just never correct. Or, even worse, the data source becomes inaccurate later down the road and then the client points it out, which makes our reports that we put so much time into untrustworthy.

I have had the same experience before, wrangling data is not as easy as one would think. And IMO should be done by the same people that need to use the data, so much can go wrong."

10vz1xf,j7kd451,3,"ML is not required at all for entry level jobs. The only skills that as re needed for an entry level role are excel, sql and Tableau/Power BI. Don't waste your time learning ML if you are having a hard time.. You can learn it later at your job in free time.. I would recommend learning python though as it sometimes comes in handy for messy or large datasets.. But again not a requirement for entry level jobs. Luke Baurousse on youtube has made a very interesting job tracker app using streamlit that you can use to see what skills are most common for data analyst jobs..Python/R comes in at like no. 4 or 5"

10vz1xf,j7ldty2,1,I must add here that I am already learning python in a data mining and advanced statistical analysis class that I am taking in the university and also a class on sql
10vz1xf,j7rvst2,1,"I took an NLP/ text as data class in grad school without really any coding background, it was python based. I think the things I learned in it made me a lot better at working with messy complicated datasets, at the time I wished I had been more prepared in terms of coding but I managed to get through it. 

That said, it probably depends on what type of data analyst work you're hoping to do. You'll learn a lot of what you'll ultimately need to know on the job and the free resources aren't going anywhere if you find yourself wanting to upskill in the future. Most companies rely really heavily on excel and it's really common to come across monolithic internal reporting structures that people have forgotten the purpose of but are still technically required, these are often excel and it can be tough to get a company that isn't very small to consider switching. However, and this depends a lot on your learning style and level of motivation, more complicated topics around machine learning and NLP can be tough to tackle without an instructor and if the costs are the same I'm more confident I can teach myself excel formulas with youtube videos than I can the intuition of various ML algorithms. FWIW there's a pretty good chance you're never going to need the notation you use in class again unless you're part of like an ML research team or something."

2.	leaders who have some familiarity with the work involved in scaling solutions and are willing to commit to choices of how solutions are built.  Design of these solutions is critical and you can’t be wishy washy every week on a new scenario. 
3.	hire analysts who want to solve problems and have basic common sense and possibly can code ok.   NOT some person who wants to spend 3 weeks tweaking some grid search or arguing over RMSE vs MAE to judge a model.  If you hire these people you are in trouble."
11ddjji,ja8z6qq,8,"It is quite interesting how meaningless data jobs seems to be a global phenomena across cultures - implying that this is stemming from someting deeper e.g. human nature or global corporate system. I'm struggling with the same problem as a data scientist and I've only recently become aware of it - leading to ""checking out"" from the job. 

I think that's why I am drawn more into robotics, where I feel the impact is more measurable and concrete. Chasing the dragon, in this case a meaningful job with good benefits, is a viable option to combat this inherit nihlism. However, those jobs where everything is close to perfect are rare."
11ddjji,ja84jww,37,"This is a very cynical view of the industry. It seems to imply that “bad data” is a symptom of some self-reinforcing loop that aims to keep business users in the dark, hiding the secret that data integrity is an illusion and no one knows what is going on.

In reality, it is extremely difficult to maintain quality data at scale, especially over time. We need data professionals to keep data healthy, which means organizations need solid data engineers, BI engineers, data analysts, business analysts, etc. 

What is the alternative this article is suggesting? We just close our eyes and pretend data doesn’t exist? Obviously we need to be doing better as an industry, but the tone of this article does not help move us forward."

11ddjji,ja8i8wp,3,"It's a layered issue that can involve a mix of unfulfilling work due to the inherent nature of the business (SaaS, eCommerce, email marketing, etc.) and/or mismanagement and misunderstanding about how to leverage data even if the business has intrinsic value (healthcare, some areas of finance, engineering, urban planning, etc.).

An overarching issue is that the optics of work often outrank the impact and mechanisms involved in work. It's not difficult to find data related managers and executives who are simply coasting until retirement and who don't feel an obligation to actually manage."
11ddjji,jaajuxi,5,"I mean I agree with what he's saying but I think the only true way to solve it on a personal level is to stop caring so much. You'll probably never find a data job in the corporate world that is actually fulfilling. Even if you somehow find a role in a 'profit center' that directly contributes to the bottom line you'll likely only be okay for a time period and then it will be back to the baseline of pointlessness. I've found the most effective solution is just tune it all out and do the minimum needed for the current role. I view my company strictly as a black box in which I put it in some time in return for money. I don't do anything unethical or illegal but I also am done with going the extra mile. Allowing yourself to be upset about the whole thing is just pissing into the wind. Does that make me a grifter like this guy is complaining about? Sure. And I don't care. It's just press buttons, get paycheck to me at this point in my life."

11ddjji,jaaug52,1,"Nice article. I work at a private sector company whose core product is data and our database is still mostly undocumented. It seems like a lot of the people in charge, while they are smart and often understand the business well, just don't have a strong understanding of tech and data. All technical work seems to be vaguely seen as necessary but low status. 

Even with money at stake, things can get fairly inefficient and bureaucratic. Once that's gone, I imagine things can get even worse. Not too surprising that this guy is talking about the public sector."
11ddjji,jabdhcj,1,"This is a good article, and it is really why I am a socialist. 

I think what the author experiencing is  (According to wiki) ""Karl Marx's theory of alienation, which describes the estrangement (German: Entfremdung) of people from aspects of their human nature (Gattungswesen, 'species-essence') as a consequence of the division of labor and living in a society of stratified social classes. The alienation from the self is a consequence of being a mechanistic part of a social class, the condition of which estranges a person from their humanity.\[1\]"" 

This alienation is true for really any work you have as the working class. We are work units in the cog of the capitalists machine. 

Data Science and ML, are unique areas because you can (usually) get paid fairly, and this alone is a very liberating feeling, even if you work is often meaningless. 

But I think when you realize that work is pointless due to the systematic failure of capitalism rather than an individual mistake or personal choice to not ""follow your dream"" you can feel allot better life/work."
11dt0n7,jaas6wo,12,"First of all, congrats on taking the plunge! Tough to do for sure. Secondly, the math and stats background will be invaluable moving forward. My advice to you would be: Focus on learning some programming. Start with SQL as it is easiest and pretty much necessary for any data role. Once you have that down (to a reasonable degree: ie, joins), get into Python (some recommend R) and start a basic course for that. No real need to pay for much as a lot of online resources are free, but sometimes paying for just the organization and the curriculum is worth it (especially on Udemy when some of the classes are like 10 bucks). Don’t fall for the buzz words right off the bat. You don’t need to know how to create ML models right now. You don’t need to know how to solve hackerrank problems right now. Just start with the basics and see where that takes you. You’ll come across sample projects, sites, repos, etc and a lightbulb will go off and you’ll want to start applying what you’ve learned to creative problems you come up with yourself in the industry of your choice.

11dt0n7,jabft1g,1,"Honestly, I think the soft skills are more useful than knowing specific languages or technologies as long as you have the aptitude to learn. I've known people with ML/AI PhDs who floundered int their careers because success is really more about taking vast amounts of data and making it digestible for people to use making decisions. People that intuitively understand how to present things simply and clearly do well. I bet being a teacher will translate well."

It seems like people that wanted to go into data science b/c they were told it was sexy and made a lot of money and then found out it can really suck (usually SWE folks) and is not like many other back-end roles go into data engineering.

But the need far outstrips the supply. You may have a hard time coming back (to data science) unless you stay for less than a year or so. But there are likely to be careers in that field and probably much more growth there than the DS space for the next decade or so."
11dinjc,ja96lgg,8,DE has more job prospects than DS
11dinjc,ja95erz,6,"I think all Data Scientists will appreciate good Data Engineers. I don't think DEs are generally seen as somehow 'lower' or less skilled or competent than DSs at all. If anything, you'll probably find more DSs who shit on other DSs, rather than shitting on DEs.

If DS or MLE was something you wanted to do in the future, DE is as good as any role from that point of view I'd have thought."
11dinjc,ja9c4zx,4,"Unpopular opinion: it takes more skill to be an elite DE than elite DS.

Imagine being responsible for cleaning petabytes of low latency data pipelines for Citadel with their strict time limits lmao, gigachad work."
11dinjc,ja9pyqz,3,"More important, more employable, more skilled.

Imo"
11dinjc,ja95ven,2,"It’s pretty hard to do science on your data without any data to begin with. Certainly no DS worthy of respect would regard DE as inferior. They’re two key, separate parts of the bigger picture. 

Depending on where you work, you may end up doing a bit of both. I know I certainly do (my company is an oldie with lots of data but no formalized structure..yet)."
11dinjc,ja9kyzn,2,"Data Scientist, ML Engineers and Analyst are useless without good data engineering"
11dinjc,ja96l6w,2,"I don't think transitioning from a DE role to a DS role is easy.  There isn't a ton of overlap between the two jobs, so you aren't going to necessarily ""get credit"" for DE work a few years down the road when you want to apply to DS roles.  If anything it might make it harder to get a DS role at the pay level you want when you do want to make that switch.  I work at a FAANG company and hire for both roles.  It's entirely possible to transition within a company once you are hired, but like anything that depends on circumstance (job availability) and drive on the part of the employee to take on projects that demonstrate DS knowledge.

EDIT: that said, startups are a different beast and there is often opportunity to wear multiple hats.  Ask them how much exposure you'll have to DS projects, and if there is a possibility to split the role as DS/DE or transition to DS in the future"
11dinjc,ja9q4x4,1,"Without a doubt it's a plus. You can't make it in engineering without having technical skills.  And as a DS that has to jump into engineering more often than I'd like, you will have a lot of respect right out of the gate. A good Engineer is about as high on the food chain as it gets."

11dhzea,ja99yk5,2,"'Intro to data science' and 'the data science method' by IBM on coursera might be a good place to start for you - don't actually pay for the certification (just audit it) as it won't actually *teach* you how to do any data science for yourself at all. What it *will* do is summarise the whole field and the 'big idea' for you in an overview-for-management kind-of-way, and from there you will be able to come back with a more refined question of *what it is* you want to do. Watch it like a documentary.

Also, any intro probability and stats book/video, assuming you have 0 data background. You *need* to know the ideas of statistics on datasets of 20 datapoints, before you start worrying about getting a computer to deal with 500k datapoints. I would actually say if you have *no* background in statistics the best thing to do would be just put 30 datapoints of X and Y in Excel and work through a basic statistics book, getting Excel to help you with the calculations as it is so easy to use - forget the 'data science' part for now (which I personally define just as statistics with fancy algorithms)."
11dhzea,ja9c806,2,"None right off the bat. You’re better off reading about basic business and analytics concepts,the data lifecycle, and common analytics tools and use cases. All of this is available for free online, Google is your friend. 

Once you figure out the landscape you can start learning SQL on W3Schools or other free platforms. Get comfortable with it until you know how to extract, manipulate, and aggregate data. Pay special attention to date formats. 

Then you will need to learn a visualization tool you can use to create dashboards and expose insights from the data. The most common ones are Tableau and PowerBI, but there are others such as Superset."
11cxziu,ja5o4rz,131,"With a degree in math and a MS in Analytics, plus 10 years in DS and 5 in DL, I can say this:

ML/DL math is complex and at times hard to digest but by no means a requirement to apply ML/DL successfully. 

If you were to be a contributer (coder) to libraries, say Scikit-Learn, than you better truly ""know"" the math. But to use and apply it successfully you need only have a strong understanding of fundamentals, not deep theoretical algorithm decomposition, et. al."
11cxziu,ja5o82a,39,">I am worried that I won't be able to fully internalize all of these proofs and derivations before the job search.

I will never ask you to do this in an interview. It is important you know what's going on inside the models so you know whether applying it to a problem is appropriate or not. If you're working tabular data, let's face it -- you're drawing lines through points in space -- sure, it's multidimensional space and your line is some sort of hyperplane or whatever, but you get the point. Understanding enough of the model to explain it to someone else is a good standard, imo.

Get through your coursework, start working. On the job you'll always have access to this nifty thing called ""the internet"", where you can refresh your understanding, as needed."
11cxziu,ja6svjv,7,"How much mathematical background do you have?  Do you find the mathematics itself hard (vector calculus, linear algebra, optimization) or is the specific content?  If it's the first, then you need to work on that quickly, but if it's the second it's not so abnormal to feel as you do.

I think it's not needed to internalize the proofs and derivations but you should internalize the concepts of the models, the setting and why the algorithms work, and when they don't.

I remember understanding some of my undergraduate classes a few months after they ended.

I was doing physics research with algorithm creation for some time before I moved to DS so it wasn't a big difference.  You learn much more by doing where you learn one technique inside and out for your particular problem, and then you learn others as ancillaries as you follow references or just get curious.

The EM/GMM isn't actually all that difficult when you program it concretely.

Can you explain concretely what's happening in a simple example?   Like this level is good enough: 

""A: OK so we already know how to fit one Gaussian to data, but now we need to fit a few different Gaussians because we think there are multiple blobs. (use dry erase to make dots on whiteboard).

So now we pretend each data point has a switch between which blob it belongs to, like blob 1 or blob 2 or blob 3.  But it's hidden so we have to make guesses. We make a weighting array for all the possibilities, one per point. These sum up to 1 and are nonnegative.

E stage is guessing the the selection for each point.  We use the existing gaussian parameters and we figure out the probability of the point under those gaussians with bayes rule.  This gives the relative weights of being in 'blob 1' 'blob 2' and 'blob 3'.   When you're done, re-estimate the gaussians having now had a candidate assigment of the points in to the various groups in a weight fraction.  This is fitting Gaussian mean and variance with a weighting for each point, the weighting given by the previous estimation.  Now go back again and re-estimate the hidden choice for each point.  This should converge on a fixed assignment and then you're done.""

""Q: Why do we need to do this?""

""A: because we don't know how to fit both of them at the same time but each individual problem is easy if you keep the other parts fixed""

""Q: So what do you get out of it?""

""A: Two things: an estimate of the probability density, and estimate of which group each point belongs to, like by taking the highest weighting for each point."" 
Mathematical notation makes it obscure but the idea isn't obscure if made concrete.  Like this requires some puzzling over if you first read it (and don't know what's happening):  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EM_algorithm_and_GMM_model

The basic idea of iterative algorithms which switch between two different phases is common, it happens when simultaneous estimation can't be done but each subproblem can be done."
11cxziu,ja5yl7l,12,"I'm still learning something new about the algorithms I use every time I invest the time to dig a little bit under the hood.

Generally, I think the idea that you hole yourself up in a cave, studying to emerge with a complete understanding of an algorithm rather unrealistic. 

You're much better off trying to use the algorithm with a naive understanding of the mechanisms, meeting roadblocks then clarifying these roadblocks with follow-up studying. It means having to accept that you're always going to be a lifelong learner, even after you leave your university.

Case in point, I felt I ""understood"" everything about linear regression when I graduated, because I knew how to call `lm.fit()`. And today, I realise just how little of the entire scope of linear modelling I actually managed to internalise."
11cxziu,ja65cz4,11,"The good news is that companies don't pay you to know the derivations and formulas. They pay you to be able to do ML on real-world data. Focus on application over understanding first principles, because that is what will ultimately be required of you in a DS career. As a Lead DS, I can comfortably say I don't remember many of the equations and derivations, and would likely struggle in that part of the class as much as you are. 

The catch here is that the more junior the job you're applying for, the more likely you are to be asked a 'gotcha' question in this realm. The way you can avoid this is by having strong experience applying these models on school/personal projects. Interviewers will almost always settle for a high-level explanation of a technical topic if you follow it up with comments that show practical experience working with these models on non-trivial problems."
11cxziu,ja6grj8,5,Lol is this ISYE 6740? I was struggling with GMM too.
11cxziu,ja7oo28,3,"ML courses are usually taught by academics - they prepare you to appreciate the rigor behind a field and be able to understand the origins and mathematical manipulations behind each model.

In school, everything about ML deals with the lowest level - the mathematical formulation, the optimization method, the bounds on solvability. This is like studying materials science and fluid mechanics as an aeronautical engineer. You will get into the depths of the effects of mixing a small impurity on material hardness, the depths of solving the mechanics of arbitrary fluid flows on a wing.

But in reality, an aeronautical engineer needs to do one simple thing - engineer a reliable system that flies. All of the fine-grained knowledge is only supposed to serve that big picture. That's what adds value and makes money.

So apply the same analogy to data and ML.

In real world jobs, you will be judged on your ability to apply statistics and data manipulation skills. Unless a job requires ML research skills, it is nonsensical to test mathematical proofs and derivations. If you want a Data Science or Applied ML job and this material is on the interview, take it as feedback that the hiring manager/team have a confused picture of how data science can add value to an organization.

In the real world, you need to be able to manipulate ML at a HIGH level. Can you achieve and verify a converged model? Can you measure model performance in terms of error, reliability, and statistical confidence? Can you connect your understanding of a model to some business logic? Can you deploy a successful model and monitor it to keep it on track?

Don't stress - try to pass your courses while working on good projects. This is a great field with a lot of growth potential."
11cxziu,ja6aavv,12,"You took/are in the wrong class - DS is not a mathematician. DS workflow is similar to a physicist - physicist uses math, but only as a tool.

Analogy #1: Like a race car driver - uses cars/engines/tires, but does not know how to make any of those. However, pro drivers do know characteristics of each and what they are good for - road types, speed, dynamics, maneuvering, etc.

Analogy #2: Math books teach you, in excruciating detail, how to build a tennis racket, but are not interested at all to teach you how to use it to win Wimbledon, so to speak.

Re mathematical intuition: Proofs do not provide intuition type DS seeks/wants. High-level explanations do, along with concrete pragmatic/practical examples and analogies. One usually cannot find any of that in math books. They are usually dry and strictly proof-driven with close to zero non-trivial data examples shown."
11cxziu,ja7m7wv,2,"It can take months or even years to properly understand what even one class of algorithms is doing and how that carries over when working with data. This is why research is so difficult. Entire semesters are dedicated to topics like the linear model and SVMs. Going through one algorithm a lecture is hardly going to give you the kind of clarity you're talking about.

The good news is that others, like the people who made the class you're in, as well as the people waiting to interview you for a job, understand this. High-level understanding is usually all that is required to do well in industry. You can do the proofs later if you want or need to."

11djjcm,ja9p8ti,18,"As a fellow hiring manager, if there is one thing I believe in is that there are only three things you are *really* looking for when hiring for most DS roles:

1. The ability to get shit done
2. The ability to learn new things
3. The ability to get along with the people they will be working with

Yes, there are some core things a candidate should know, but for most DS jobs that is like 20% of what hiring managers try to evaluate. 

There are exceptions - if you are in an industry where domain knowledge is very difficult/slow to acquire, you may want to prioritize that. Or if you're a very mature organization that has a bunch of models in production and you need someone to go squeeze an extra 0.1% of performance out of  them? Yeah, you probably want to hire someone deep, deep into ML.

But for 95% of jobs where you need someone to predict standard-ass financial, marketing, sales, supply chain events using the same data - neither the domain knowledge nor the technical knowledge is *that* important. Profit is price minus cost. Churn is losing customers. Win rate is opportunities won / total opportunities. It's not freaking rocket science.

Yes, I am oversimplifying it, and all of these things can get pretty complex. But enver in my life have I met someone who was smart enough to understand machine learning that wasn't smart enough to learn about the basics of business.

The three issues I have seen with data scientists that were, on paper, good:

1. They are lazy, they think they're too good to do what is actually their job, or they get bogged down by details to the point where they never deliver anything.
2. They don't like to learn new things, and think that the things they already know are they only important ones.

There really must be some kind of opportunity there if the company has no history of DS/ML.

Apologies if this is rude/presumptious, but your next step should be to research applications of DS/ML in your particular industry and then, armed with that knowledge, figure out where the opportunities in your company are.

If you're lacking in infrastructure due to the lack of data maturity in your company, you might want to start with non-production type projects. E.g. a segmentation/cluster analysis with some 'actionable' recommendations for business/marketing stakeholders at the end of it. It'll be best to figure out what the 'easy wins' are in your environment and go with those."

I ended up taking over control of the tool and rebuilt it from the ground up, improving speed reliability and documentation. 
All of this is to say, their lack of understanding of what they needed allowed me (and continues to allow me) to really define my role and have a lot of freedom in the kinds of projects I work on. My company as a whole has a lot of data scientists and analytics people so I’ve worked with people from tons of different areas on lots of different things.

11cf8mk,ja3opdp,8,"Difficult position and a steep learning curve. Here are some tips that aren’t concrete but will help. 

1. Get a feel for the company: interview colleagues and get a feel for the data landscape: what do they use, how do they use it. Note any opportunities for automation—You need to show quick wins to highlight value of data. 

2. Set an infrastructure goal. If you have existing cloud solutions, great. Get in these calls immediately. 

3. Use cases. Along side with an infrastructure goal, build use cases from your interviews. Your primary goal is to win support. You will not be providing any crazy value from the get go, but solving internal problems and making your colleagues lives easier makes you a reliable resource. 

4. If you have the resources, spend time implementing quick wins. If at all possible, try get yourself attached to a product team / project. Managing projects solo is fuckin rough. For example, you noticed an excel is passed around. You decide automating this with a pipeline. If you’re assigned to the project, maybe they have an existing cloud subscription / resource you could get your hands on and solve the problem. It also allows you to get closer to close knit team. 

5. Showcase quick wins to the team. If you’ve worked closely with a product team, hopefully that manager sees the value and can vouch for you, and they get an idea of what you do. This will open opportunities. 

6. Now I kinda glossed over how all of this infrastructure is connected, and I can’t answer that; it’s context dependent. But, the more data you’ve connected and pooled together means more opportunities for you to do cool shit. 

Anyway, this is what I did, and now I’m up to the stage of doing cool shit. I’m finally deploying models and I get sat on high level meetings."

For tips on mastering the material, can you attempt to create analogies? Can you use spaced repetition? Do you often test yourself?

Machine Learning and AI stuff is good to know for interviews but in the real world you are going to spend a lot more time doing exploration analysis and doing basic data tests using various methods, maybe the occasional prediction.

The fastest way of learning is to create github projects trying to explore a question in a scientific manner then go through setting up the study design, exploring the data, sampling the data, setting up a hypotheses, testing the hypothesis with sample data using multiple methods and writing your conclusions. Throw some graphs in there to make it pretty.

Once you got about 10 projects or so under your belt, join a peer learning group for data science and present your results. Oh and polish. People like polish regardless of the facts. So make it as eye catching and clear as possible.

&#x200B;

Edit: also once you got your projects looking pretty and such they are great to add to your resume. If you are still having trouble looking for a job that will accept you with little experience, try for an analyst job and move up; otherwise, work for free at a startup for about 8 mo (earn some good favor with the company that will vouch for you) then re-apply for analytic positions."

11dhopf,ja8qf33,2,"Check the wiki page for RBFs. The first paragraph actually encapsulates the difference between these two categories.

An RBF is supposed to depend only on the sample’s distance from a chosen center, usually 0.

If you choose to focus on 1D inputs with the Euclidean metric with 0 as your center, then this means RBFs in that space must be even functions. You’ll notice that the two valid RBFs in your post are even, while the invalid ones are not.

Bear in mind that you have to rely on the proper definition if you are working in other metric spaces or use a different center. The “even function” thing is a special case that’s good as an introduction, but it’s not always that simple.

Edit: wait… brain fart. Sine is odd, not even, so my simplification isn’t quite right because I specifically chose 0 as the center. But there is an offset you could apply to make it even, depending on your frequency. The other functions have no such offset, so they can never be used as RBFs."

Secondly, you are probably talking to a lot of companies/hiring managers. So, you probably get a much larger exposure than any of us. What would you recommend to people to pay attention to when talking to a possible new employer? What are the red flags you are seeing constantly?"

What do you think should I do, that can be the next best thing to work experience? Is the work exp that important because from my observation, many of my friends who got placed aren't really making an active contributions... they're more like ""trainees"". 

Also, do you think having a gap on my resume is going to hurt my chances to land up in a good company in the US? Will this bad decision haunt me forever?

So frankly don't bother with those jobs. You'd probably be better off anyways. Focus more on getting experience as an Analyst/Data Analyst role with a company that is similarish to the public health field. You will probably be overqualified at first but get a couple of years under your belt and you will advance faster.

I'd try and get some basic programming, SQL, mathematical statistics, calculus, linear algebra and regression analysis under your belt first.

Try and take a look at each subject in detail and if it looks like it is heavy on the theoretical math, maybe avoid it. To be honest though, even looking at subjects like ""Foundations in Data Analysis"" it looks like a reasonably theoretical approach. It might be too tough if you haven't done some preparation as an undergrad.

11bq133,j9zhcyh,28,"Some suggestions, take it or leave it:

Skills

* I personally would remove advanced/proficient/familiar annotations from your skills section
* Call it Tools or something other than Computer Skills
* Remove MS Office from Computer Skills - it implies a certain style that may not be in your benefit

Experience

* Your top bullets in each work experience should be your most impactful and quantitative. I see you've put some effort into quantifying your impact, which is great, but you should move those to be first rather than a qualitative bullet like ""maximize \[company's\] workforce potential"".
* Bullets 2+3 under the top experience need to be combined and reworded
* At a senior level, every highlighted experience (bullet) should connect to business impact. Bullets like the one starting ""Used lasso regression..."" are great and interesting, but you would benefit from saying what the impact of ""identify\[ing\] the main drivers of attrition"" was for your company

It's not bad overall, just some things that I would do. It's a tough market right now."
11bq133,j9z6zrk,46,"Yeah, I'd call you in for an interview.

It's a recession and a tough time to get a job. But I don't think your resume or experience is the problem.

The biggest thing that helped me, when I was looking for a job, was to apply more filters on job search sites. When you apply to the jobs you see on the first page, you're against everybody. When you dig a little, you get a much higher response rate."
11bq133,j9zhj48,9,"It looks like a good resume to me too, but our company has a hiring freeze. I’m sure tons of others are in the same boat."
11bq133,j9znv5t,6,"I recently got hired at a senior level. Like others have said, the economy is tough so you’ll likely not get your first round picks of companies, but others definitely are still hiring. Actually, even companies that are laying off might still be hiring in business units they are investing more heavily in, while shedding headcount in divested BUs. If you are looking for roles in people analytics only, that might be why it’s significantly tougher.

As for your resume, it looks great. Lots of business impact, but the format is very compact. I would add more white space by removing less impactful bullets, to better pass that 5 second rule (whatever the rule is for glancing over a resume). ie Lasso regression bullet should go, condensing bullets 2 and 3 of your first experience

I think you can condense machine learning skills significantly. Firstly, use abbreviations (eg GLM). Secondly, do away with proficiency, and just list the methods you know. Thirdly, unless a job post specifically calls out CNN or RNN, you can just leave it as Deep Learning, at which point, you can leave it to the interviewer to ask more about your knowledge in a specific domain. E.g. someone who doesnt list deep learning requirements in the post, but happens to be looking for CNN skills will likely already have their interests piqued by you listing Deep Learning."
11bq133,ja0a7ej,5,"I think your experience and results are impressive, but I think you’re hiding it a bit. When there are lots of applications, you need to be punchy and concise. Your resume looks like a million other resumes, despite being better than many. Reading this closely, I am left with the impression that you’ve had a lot of impact and would want to interview you… if this was on a stack of resumes I am not sure I would catch it. 

Probably minor but I would fix some typos, grammar and syntax. Like “CPG Clients” should be “CPG clients.” In the first bullet under Senior Data Scientist, you have a run on sentence. Degree is expected in 2023. 

I wouldn’t put “advanced” or “familiar.” Either you know it or you don’t. Use the work you’ve done to support how skilled you are.

Throughout, you can be more concise. “Predicted attrition using a Lasso regression model using Python.” “Assisted in various applications” can go away or become “[specific action verb] the Deep Learning Pay Inference tool.”

Consider the prominence of your business outcomes. In your 2019-2021 role, you generated 2.5mm in sales but hide that. Your headline for that role is just buzzwords that don’t say anything. Or, you bury the outcome at the end of sentences (try “Reduced job titles by 42% by building an NLP algorithm that consolidated job titles based on job descriptions” or “Created an action plan that reduced turnover by 8% by modeling attrition probability using logistic regression, CATBoost and survival analysis”). 

Your verbs should be meaningful descriptions of what you did. “Assisted” is what? Be specific. Did you recommend a model? Did you do a code review? Were you just on the team when it happened? Did you plan the work? Be specific. 

Also, personal preference, but I like to see job titles before where you work or what department you’re in. Senior Data Scientist, People Analytics. Firm. Date range. 

For skills, I am usually a fan of placing that at the end when you have meaningful work experience unless you are concerned that your experience doesn’t speak for itself. I would want the reader’s first impression of you to be that you did work that resulted in 11 million in investment, not clutter about skillset. A fresh student or someone doing a career pivot, maybe, but not here. 

Likewise, you have enough work experience to consider placing the student section below your work experience. 

Likewise, on spoken languages, unless they are relevant to the job, leave them out."
11bq133,ja0gm8z,2,Resume looks pretty good. I would recommend putting your work experience at the top. Your experience is more valuable than your education so I'd highlight that.

11bq133,j9zhlpn,1,"Nice profile. A couple suggestions. Instead of the Skills… section I would rather read a Summary / Highlights section at the beginning, really only 3-4 bullet points about yourself. Who are you (how do you define yourself), what are you focusing on, what is your specialty? E.g.
- Senior data scientist focusing on / specialized in…
- X years of experience in…
- Looking for…
Etc.

Otherwise your Skills section is currently a bit chaotic for my taste. You mention that you are proficient in Java, yet I cannot see Java among your works below (or have I missed something?). The section is overall crowded and I am not sure if you should really enumerate all the models you have ever worked with. It gives somewhat a junior feeling (e.g. that you mention K-Means… what about all the poor other ones, you have never tried them?) Instead, I would just say: classical ML models + Deep Learning (focus: …), NLP etc. So this part I would clean up a bit, otherwise the rest is very nice, comgratulations."

Simulations can have multiple ML models integrated within them as well.  This could fall under a SWE role but technical data scientists can do it. It is very industry dependent though.

If you're looking to swap companies, look for companies that are consumer facing and then try to find some of the companies they partner with.

It’s really what you absorbed from that schooling and how you can use your knowledge to solve problems and think critically and creatively.

Data scientists come from all sorts of educational backgrounds (I have degrees in Bio Engineering) so just home some of the skills I mentioned above and practice!"

That said it sounds like I had more maths in my degree program certainly at the masters level my degree was extremely quant heavy. I would say you probably have the skills and experience for an analyst position at this point and may either need further education or a lot of on the job learning to get the maths.

All that said in my experience it will depend somewhat on what industry you want to be in. I started out as a big 4 consultant working in economic analysis and had plenty of education for they were looking for and they taught me the rest. From there I took a masters advancing my stats background, got recruited by the IMF and picked up a lot more maths as well as hard core research skills (publishing a few papers) and now finally I’m serving as a high level senior scientist at a quant fund start up. 

Point is you may not be jumping straight into a DS position but there’s more than one way to get there. I’d say you’re more of an analyst out the gate and then with some serious work on your stats background and programming skills you can get there.

But they seemed reluctant to admit that they didn't know something so they often seemed to pass off their best guess as a definitive answer. 

The majority of modern DS work will allow some amount of working from home, so sharing information really isn't an issue (I guess if you're in a different country there are some situations where that could cause a problem though). Having said that, you might find that companies are reluctant to hire a fully remote junior."

11cwdh4,ja7tb9t,2,"I'm betting there is a bit of a language difference here. If you mean that you're a data scientist in the US or EU, and a citizen (or green card holder / European equivalent), then lots of firms offer remote options (or require them).

If you mean a data scientist that wants to work with US or EU companies outside of those geographies then it's much, much harder to land positions."
11cwdh4,ja5ix40,2,"Fully remote jobs for entry level roles are rare  and hard to get. 

If you already have the job, building trust with the employer and slowly first going hybrid and eventually fully remote is a more realistic scenario. 

The issue of companies not wanting to let sensitive data out to remote workers is generally real for US companies, more so when employees are not at least remote within the continental US.  It is highly unlikely for a US company with a serious IT/cybersecurity group to hire a brand new employee and let sensitive data to be accessed or reside on the laptop of a remote worker that lives in an area where the company has no legal jurisdiction or oversight.  

Anyone who says, “I am or know someone working remote therefore remote DS jobs are common”, they don’t have a clue about the danger of extrapolating from limited data and you should question if they are even in DS to begin with."

I think your approach to this, though, is never going to get executive support. Projected revenue impact of an A/B Test from a consulting agency is always a bullshit number, and every client you have is always going to treat it that way. 

Your approach to this problem is to try to make that number more accurate -- but if you succeed, will that increase your agency's sales? Will your clients start believing your numbers?

Absolutely not. They'll just assume your number is bullshit, too, no matter how rigorous your methods are.

Your executive team wants to make their impact seem as big as possible. And, yes, lying about impact is dangerous -- but you're still solving for the wrong problem. What you should be focused on is:

- How can we increase client trust in how we *present* our projections?
- How can we make sure we're ready to persuasively answer client skepticism?
- How can we provide concrete pieces of proof that we really are having an impact that will make us hard to drop?"
11bp73d,j9zed3o,7,"I work DS - Analytics in a big tech company and a large part of my role is experimentation.

It’s possible that an A/B test would eventually regress, but do you have logical business reasons to believe it would? There’s nothing that specifically says a change should eventually regress.

Regardless, there’s ways to measure this risk:

When assessing the test results, take a look at the difference between control and treatment for the relevant metrics over time. If this trend is stable or even increasing, then it’s a positive sign that this metric improvement is real and long(er) term.

In order to monitor the potential regression of AB test results, you can also open a small holdout experiment (traffic depends on size of business) on the control group of the original experiment after you close it out. You can keep this running long term and observe if there’s long term implications of your change. This is a standard practice in big tech companies that have the AB testing infrastructure in place. The holdout experiment also has the added benefit of observing whether the feature actually *improves* even more in the long term (which is possible and I’ve seen happen!)"
11bp73d,j9zroyf,2,"There isn't a hard rule around how robust an AB test result is to time - that is something that is highly dependent on the domain and data. However, if you wanted to add some more certainty around the result given time that is something you'd have to add to the experiment.  This could include (and others have mentioned also):  


* A hold out control group while you make the changes from your successful AB test.
* Holding off on making changes and conduct several AB test built around domain seasonality.
* Similar to the above but with the same cohorts follow up at several periods (this depends on your outcome variable)."

11c1g8e,ja1n8sk,6,"You’re diving straight into the ML without doing the data science. Take a step back and first ask questions, do some data analysis. ML should be the very last step. Some questions off the top of my head:
1) How would it operationally work? Think backwards as the customer. Would I as the customer be receiving a recommendation for 1 new brand? Am I being recommended 5 new brands? Will you show me a diverse set of brands or will they all be very similar? Eg: I like shoes but only bought shoes from Nike. Will you show me Adidas, Jordans, Steve Madden shoes or will you show me a different shoe brand along with maybe a pair of socks that go along with.

2) Data Analysis: Do you see evidence of customers forming clusters of similar brands they are spending money in? How tight or dispersed are these clusters? I would assume customers who spend across different brands might be more interested in receiving recommendations that customers who are loyal to specific brands

Your ML approach might drastically change based on answers to these questions."
11c1g8e,ja1z4x8,1,"1. Get a top line metric from the business side or work it out with them. If no one knows, drop the project. For example MAP wouldn’t work if you have only 1 slot to display the recommendation. How you label your data will also depend on this.
2. Your data might still be sparse depending on the brand distribution and especially with only those 4 columns.
3. Try to find more features. As it is you’re effectively encoding users and brands as categorical variables. At least you can try to add external info about the brands.
4. A bank in particular has super valuable user features, the kind third parties would pay hard cash to use in their models. Try to get access to those features even if you need to work out the compliance aspect. It will be much harder if they are your client instead of employer but it’s usually worth asking.
5. Be very careful about how you model non-interaction, i.e. brands the customer has not bought from. Does spending a little on a brand mean better affinity than not buying? Do you know if the customer was exposed to the brand or not? Does your collaborative filtering implementation let you ignore certain entries of the input matrix?"

11ax9fy,j9upo0l,369,The pay is shit
11ax9fy,j9uy553,65,"+1 to the comments regarding it being difficult to break in and the compensation generally being lower than other industries. 

I wanted to hop in and provide a response geared towards “okay, I get that but I’m still interested, how do I get noticed?” . FWIW, I do not work in sports analytics, but am active in the public facing sports analytics space and because of that have some thoughts that I feel to be relevant and helpful. 

- start building up an online presence. There’s a healthy online sports analytics community on Twitter, here on Reddit, and in other places. It gives you the platform to share your work and insights. 

- feeding off point 1, I’d recommend starting small but then finding an area that hasn’t been fully explored or perhaps is lacking public facing work. Nothing wrong with not reinventing the wheel to get the hang of things but if you want to be noticed, then it is advantageous to find a niche. You’d be surprised that this often times doesn’t require the most advanced techniques/methods. 

- participate in contests. Big Data Bowl winners and honorable mentions have been using that as a means of getting jobs with teams/adjacent to the industry. It’s not just football either. There is a hockey competition (Big Data Cup) and there recently was a horse racing one. There are more for those still in school, but regardless there are opportunities to get your hands on data and try to answer some difficult questions. 

- attend conferences. Some are less expensive and not as predatory (Sloan is very expensive, but Carnegie Melon’s is not…for example). Heck, you can even try to get a project accepted for a presentation (SABR Analytics is a good example). 

- network. Pretty self explanatory! 

Hope this helps!"
11ax9fy,j9unucs,69,"This is anecdotal from my graduating class even before COVID lockdowns.

Sports analytics (for big teams) is extremely saturated because of how few positions there are. You'll get hundreds/thousands of applicants for DA/DS roles for big sports companies. And those companies pay very little for highly qualified individuals. We're talking $40-50k/yr for someone with an MS or PhD, and that's if you get in. When you hit senior levels, you're looking at closer to $90k-120k but I haven't personally met anyone at that level.

[Here's some real salaries](https://h1bsalary.online/index.php?searchtext=NEW%20YORK%20YANKEES)

> NEW YORK YANKEES PARTNERSHIP 	DIRECTOR OF PERFORMANCE SCIENCE 	150,000.00

> NEW YORK YANKEES PARTNERSHIP 	PRINCIPAL SPORT SCIENTIST 	110,000.00

I don't know how NY does seniority levels but at my company ""Principal"" means at least 6-7 years of experience but closer to 8-10.

If you're talking about DS for things like sports betting, that's a whole different story. Those jobs pay way more but have requirements more in-line with quantitative analysts."
11ax9fy,j9uun7s,21,"If you’re interested in working with sports data but also interested in getting paid, sports gambling/ “gaming” teams can be an option."
11ax9fy,j9v531z,38,"I would say part of what is challenging is the difference between sports analytics and analytics for sports teams.

Meaning - there is a difference between doing analytics to help the sports team win more games vs. doing analytics to help companies in the sports space (including teams' back offices and league offices) make more money.

Sports analytics jobs are rare, and there is a huge supply/demand in balance in the favor of employers. Because there are ultimately very few teams, and each of them probably only has room for 1 or 2 data scientists.

Now, someone may ask ""but don't teams care about winning?"". Actually, teams care a LOT about winning. What is much less clear is whether a data scientist can squeeze enough value out data and modeling to actually impact that, especially when you are comparing the value to that of hirng like another analst, trainer, therapist, etc. The number of decisions that can be influenced by data science, the frequency with which they are made, and the value of DS in those decisions? Not a good equation.

What you also end up seeing as a result is a lot of younger people willing to take less pay to work in something cool. You don't see quite as many super experienced data scientists working on that side of things - at least not directly for teams. Instead, you have a pretty robust academic community that does research work there - that's where the experienced people tend to join in on the fun. 

Now, by contrast - there are a lot of businesses that run off of sports (including the sports franchises themselves). Advertising, marketing, ticket sales, merch sales, baseball cards, etc. And some of those businesses are very profitable. And someone needs to build models to support all of those operations. 

That is where there is pretty decent money. 

So, for example, the NFL league office currently has a Director of Fan Engagement Data Science role open that pays $190-$225k a year.

I'm not sure if you're a student, but I regularly see postings for internships in Data Analysis for my local USL soccer team, and I'd imagine there are plenty of opportunities to get your foot in the door at a place like that. Don't forget about all of the minor league/amateur/college teams etc. near you that might have opportunities like that. 

Otherwise, there are plenty of free resources online and with some time it shouldn't be too hard to make a little portfolio of things you've done on your own free time. I'm not sure what sport(s) you're interested in, but Statsbomb is a great resource that has free webinars and data sets for people interested in most major sports AFAIK.

I will say that I think sports analytics jobs do tend to pay less for equivalent skills and experience than data jobs you might be able to find in tech or finance, for example. Obviously, if you're in an important position at a franchise like the NY Yankees, I'd assume you're pretty well-compensated, but YMMV for more entry level jobs."

Broad concepts, though… real-time processing generally means the system responds to each event independently with minimal latency per event at the expense of average compute time. Batch processing collects a bunch of events and processes them together with minimal average compute time at the expense of latency.

You can often combine the two by preprocessing historical data with a scheduled batch job, and performing inference in real time by loading those preprocessed results. Done correctly, this lets you produce real time user-facing results on extremely large amounts of historical data, without having to query terabytes of data constantly.

Note that this strategy incurs engineering overhead. You have to consider edge cases like “what does the model do if the latest preprocessing job isn’t done yet” or “ how long are my preprocessed results valid for? Can I preprocess a new batch before the previous batch is too stale?”"

Long answer: if you are not using this LLM for commercial, military, surveillance, or biometric processing you can request access to Meta’s OPT-175. This model is was trained on about half the tokens as GPT3 and it’s results reflect that. 

Running this model will require 350GB of VRAM. This will cost you between 12 and 24 dollars per hour depending on which cloud provider you use and how many years of reservation you’re willing to make.

If you would like to host it on your own hardware you can use a tool like FlexGen but this works best for batch tasks. Trying to swap weights in and out of VRAM will dramatically reduce token speed.

11ax6j8,j9v6vm7,35,"I've worked at 6 companies, and this is the breakdown:

Company 1: midsize software company whose core product is DS. Everyone understands data, everything is based on data. 

Company 2: Fortune 100 dino. Everyone cares about the loudest opinion, everyone has gotten really good at torturing data to make their point. Sales run the show, and they basically can't tell a trendline from a potato. 

Company 3: Huge CPG Brand. Old company, but it's *all* data. The company is ran by marketing, and that means that everything needs to be measured, and if it's not supported by data it's just not true. To the highest level of the company, everyone can interpret basic-to-intermediate analytics. 

Company 4: Small company transforming into a software company. Everyone understands data, and even people with insane institutional knowledge were willing to yield to good data and change their approach. 

Company 5: Midsize company. Everyone thinks they understand data, very few people actually do. Data is always an anecdote to prove a point. 

Company 6: Tech dino. There is a lot of data, but there is just too much data. In too many places. No one understands all of it. Hell - no one is even aware of what all of it is. So it becomes impossible to actually level up all the data required to actually allow data to drive the big, important decisions. But at a tactical level - very data driven

Short answer - I would say that truly data driven organizations are somewhat rare. You need a weird set of conditions - mostly for data to be incredibly valuable in making decisions. It can't just be a ""oh, that's a nice little boost"". It needs to be the difference between being profitable or not."

First, data scientist is muddy as a job title. I would distinguish data scientist from product analyst from data engineer.
I expect someone with good business acumen, serious stats understanding, and coding skills in SQL/Python/R/you name it to be a data analyst. If that person has even more advanced stats skill (PhD or masters with strong XP, the ability to fine tune / create models as opposed to pick the right one to be traits of a data scientist). I expect a data analyst to be able to analyze data to derive insights, design OKRs and advise products on what to measure, etc…

I consider data engineering to be all the work to retrieve, process (understand, clean, join, etc…). It may be a separate role, or tacked to the above.

Now : 90% of the time, what people need is a data analyst. Hell, since 80% of the job is often the data engineering, I’d start with a data engineer who is stats savvy.
It took me 11 months to hire the last one, in a FAANG. But there is a lot of noise on this market, as everybody and their neighbors have those job titles nowadays. So yeah, filtering on past XP is a good way to chat the noise, but that’s hard for the newcomers."

> how did you get your first job in this domain ?

I got my first job via networking. luck, and some strategic moves over the course of about 2 years. Basically I scored a low-level job adjacent to the cool NLP work; think some somewhere between data analyst and project coordinator. From this position I got to know some of the NLP scientists and engineers, and basically asked for some simple coding tasks. I showed competence and promise, and over time the tasks got cooler and more NLP/ML-ish. Eventually, they encouraged me to apply for an engineering position, so I did and I got it. The luck is that these moves coincided with a big push to hire more engineers, so I just rode that wave. In a line: right place right time + hard work and long-term thinking.

It goes without saying, but as all the above was happening I was putting in crazy hours of self-study on the side, brushing up on math, coding, and theory. This chapter was like the best time in my life (so far!).

> Did you have publications/graduate degree before starting or your GitHub was enough ?

Both publications and graduate degree. But not really in a field relevant to NLP, so I don't credit these for getting me the job. I had basically no GitHub presence. There's no way they would have hired me if I applied from outside the organization, not without a stronger GitHub presence at a minimum. The fact that I was already a known entity was a critical ingredient for me.

> What was the most required skill/tool your recruiter asked you to have in order to hire you ?

Python + Linux.

> how many years of experience did you have before!

Zero formal years, though I had accumulated about 2 years of relevant experience while working in that low-level role I mentioned above. 100% of the competencies I need to do my job as an MLE are self-taught.

OP, it sounds like you are interested to get into NLP but don't have much relevant experience. I know that my path is not relatable to most people, because I was already at an organization that did NLP. That said, one way to become a ""known entity"" yourself without first getting hired by an org is to check whether an organization you'd like to work for has any open-source products. If so, you could contribute to them and submit some PRs. If you do this actively and have several accepted, that is a great sign that they might be interested in you. It would also get you familiar with their codebases, and also give you something awesome to talk about during an interview.

We spend a lot of money sampling data and checking it. I said let's run an ML model to predict what data is likely to be low quality, and oversample that, to detect problems. We now detect 90% of the problems we used to detect, for half the cost (saving a couple of million dollars a year).

We run experiments to try to improve things. Right now I'm looking at the best ways to analyze experiments to detect rare events - do we get correct confidence intervals with the methods we use? Are there better methods? Are there times when we can't get correct CIs, so no point even running that experiment? Yesterday I was running simulations of bootstraps. Simulate an experiment, with sample size of 1000 or 2000, resample that 5k times, repeat 1000 times. About 1200 different setups so repeat that 1200 times. I ran 1200 CPUs for about 12 hours.

You might consider a survival model instead."
11a96tj,j9santf,4,"A logistic regression literally provides estimates of log-odds for an event. Ie: log(p/1-p) where p is the probability of your event. 

Log-odds is interpreted as a 1 unit increase in X cause a b( your coefficient) increase in the log-odds (success:failure. ) you can also get the odds of success:failure by taking the exp(coefficient). So a 1 unit increase in X would increase your odds by exp(log(1/1-p)).

I don’t know how you could interpret that as a black box model. Logistic regression can be extremely informative and it sounds like it fits your use case perfectly.

What I find weird about this whole thing is he’s ok with random forest, which is a true black box model. The large number of trees in a random forest makes it near impossible to truly understand the decision process, but if he is ok with random forests just fit a boosted tree, in this case lightgbm (large sample) and run a permutation feature importance or shaply value after. That will provide you with insight into which features effect predictive power the most.   Be sure to check your variance inflation factor before fitting the model for multicollinearity and drop any columns you need to. It will skew the feature importance results.

Lightgbm would probably be the quickest method and perform the best. Split your data, train and test, check for outliers and missing data, impute missing values and if you can justify drop the outliers, fit the model with k-fold cross validation, and grid search/random search for optimal hyper parameters. Refit model to full training set with optimal hyperparamters, check predictive performance on test set, calculate r-squared and perform feature importance on test set. You’ll have a nice pretty graph that shows you which features are most influence in predicting whether a customer churns or not."

Basically, for the values that appear broken, find all the 'donor' customers by matching them on other variables and then then randomly select one of them to use as a donor to replace the broken/missing data.

MLEs/Applied Scientists are really desirable for that reason.  Tech is in a bit of a down cycle with hiring freezes, but that doesn’t change the fact that it was basically impossible to hire people with this skill set over the entire pandemic.  A lot of those open roles sat unfulfilled for close to a year and many are still open or ended up getting filled with very junior people.  So there’s still a need, just a hiring freeze in big tech.  All the juniors that are getting trained right now will alleviate the shortage slightly but I think it’s still a very solid bet.  Realistically it’s just really hard to get the type of hands on experience you need for these roles because it involves building systems that are tens of thousands of dollars to maintain per month.  

If you already have sde experience (particularly with cloud experience), that’s great.  A masters is probably the easiest path since it’s a req for a lot of companies, but you definitely can self study and build a portfolio, I see people with self taught backgrounds all the time in FANG but it involves landing as SDE or something and transitioning within the company by building a portfolio of ml projects."

First thing I’ll say is that companies need production quality code. And no offense but code written by data scientists, typically isn’t ready to go to prod. They’re paid to solve problems, not how servers work, how models are auto-retrained when metrics slip, or how to get their model to production in an automated manor. That’s where MLEs come in. They understand the gap and thrive there. Knowing the basics of DS and models and what metrics  it puts out, and can orchestrate re-training when need be. Or even just iteration help.

Expecting data scientists to do this is misguided as your asking them to do something they’ve never learned or done. They should optimize models, worry about what data they need and how to get it.

I joined a company with a lot of data. Approx 2k employees, $0.5B in revenue. They had acquired a lot of companies so ended up with tens of disconnected databases. They didn’t even know what data existed or what to do with the data. I worked on a range of different projects over the first year and consider myself a data scientist less so ML engineer. To give some ideas of the projects I worked on:

- Root cause analysis: We had continuous billing issues in one product and the VP of product of said product didn’t understand why; he was given unsatisfactory responses by our eng team. I did deep dives into the databases and the processes; to understand how data flows and then made suggestion how to tackle this best. It was rather complicated but I have a PhD in Physics and are used to complex, open ended problems. 
- Our leadership team needed an analysis of how a certain product was trending for a board of directors meeting. Because of the high stakes I was tasked with it. I had to find the required data, understand general trends, and then make a compelling visual. It was a lot of work and kinda stressful but gave me a lot of exposure. Also, when working with high-level stakeholders, they may want you to make the data “look a certain way” to support their narrative. It was hard pill to swallow as a scientist coming from Academia. I made my piece with it. 
- I spent several months data engineering one of our high-profile data products to build fact tables. It was rather straight forward in terms of transformations but I learned a lot about SQL engineering. The tables create value till this date, years later. 
- I reviewed commercial product analytics tools and started implementing one of them. It was a massive undertaking but learned a lot. I was the only one qualified enough to understand the tooling, the implementation, and business problems.

I know my situation is unique given my background but you might see there wasn’t any ML in any of the projects. To give you one more data point: I interviewed another senior data scientist. She then worked on similar types of problems in another department; no ML whatsoever. 

That said, ML (“AI” how non-tech people call it) is extremely sexy and was in our company too. A lot of folks approached me about it; with often primitive understanding of it. I learned, however, that our company is in a certain stage of their data maturity and my company needed more of an allrounder than ML expert. I use ML now more for my projects (mostly XGBoost) but it’s still a small fraction of my work.

118vld0,j9kijns,18,"This is a sentiment that I also share. I think ""data science"" can sometimes be a no mans lands. There's three key branches:

1) Business Analytics (this role to some extent always existed but is the fundamental work that drives business decisions, it's high level, using the latest BI tools out there these days)

2) ML Research (this not just using ML packages but being able to innovate on existing algorithms, build from scratch, and really have the mathematical background to understand the models you are working with).

3) Data Engineer / ML OPs ; being able to operationalize end-to-end the data applications as well as ETL pipelines that productionalize ML work from 2 and also serve downstream tables for the analyst in 1. With better cloud tools out there, this has become more manageable with a small team. 

Now the ""ideal"" data scientist is able to take on all 3 roles, but in practice, it's hard to find someone who 1) has substantial background in all 3 and 2) is able to work through the 3 roles.  I think it's easy for a data scientists to fall into one of these 3 buckets, though the real selling point of data science in its current form has been that it sits in the intersection of these 3. The problem is you easily will get people 1) slightly familiar with ML packages, but given ease of use, they just apply the packages get some results, but don't have background to verify assumptions 2) maybe don't have the programming skills to build a scalable end-to-end product, and so forth. So you can easily find yourself in ""no mans land"". Data Science is an abstract integration of these 3, but I believe the requirement for one person to embody excellence of all 3 in many cases is unrealistic and unfeasible. A better approach is a ""data science team"" which leverages skills of the individuals in an integrated fashion rather than a ""data scientist"" you may dab in all 3 but not be fully grasping all 3 at once."
118vld0,j9kd9p8,41,"I can see the picture this person is painting, but I haven't seen this materialize the way its being described.

For simplicity, let's divide the world into three factions: analysts, modelers, and engineers. Analysts take numbers and derive insights and action. Modelers take data and create inferential, predictive, prescriptive models based on them. Engineers actually make all of this work in production and at scale. 

Mature organizations have a balance of all three. And any experienced analyst, data scientist and engineer understands that you need all three functions.

Now, if you're in the early stages of DS, then you need to pick your pillar to build around - some companies built around analysts (mostly old Fortune 500 types), some around engineers (mostly tech companies), and some around data science (mostly the heavy stats fields like insurance, risk, credit, etc.). 

So yes - some companies just hired a buttload of engineers with rudimentary stats knowledge. Why? Becuase their top priority wasn't getting a great model - their priority was getting ANY model into production. 

Other companies hired a bunch of modelers and very few of anyone else. Why? Because for them the value was in getting a much better model - even if it meant running it manually in Bob's laptop.

And other companies hired a bunch of analysts. Why? Because for them the real value is to be able to convince their Gen X management layer that they need to use numbers to make decisions.

It is common, in the course of existing as a human being, not to know the boundaries of your knowledge. As a result, people get a little over-confident in terms of their proposed solutions to existing problems when they are relatively new to the space. As fast as this field has moved, we could have gone much further if we didn't have people who exemplify the ""just add more layers"" meme occupying the most impactful positions after a few cert courses or just a dazzling show during interviews. In language that techies can understand: a senior SWE is still effectively a junior in ML topics unless they studied for years and/or had people above them who could correct their mistakes.

Hugging Face tokenizers have a feature where you can pad sequence length to a multiple of 8 to get this speedup."
119ak21,j9mn9wp,10,"The historical reason for the tendency for software devs to use powers of 2 is due to byte alignment on processors.

Processors read and write memory more efficiently when they store data at an address that's a multiple of the data size. For example, a 4-byte integer is accessed more efficiently if it's stored at an address that's a multiple of 4. When data isn't aligned, the processor does more address calculation work to access the data.

By default, the compiler aligns data based on its size: char on a 1-byte boundary, short on a 2-byte boundary, int, long, and float on a 4-byte boundary, double on 8-byte boundary, and so on.

Additionally, by aligning frequently used data with the processor's cache line size, you can improve cache performance. For example, say you define a structure whose size is less than 32 bytes. You may want to use 32-byte alignment to ensure all instances of the structure are cached efficiently.

Nowadays, at least for CPUs, you usually don't need to worry about alignment. For the compiler example, modern compilers generally aligns data on natural boundaries that are based on the target processor and the size of the data.

But maybe for GPUs the story is a bit different as another poster said.

In general though, alignment has sort of stuck in the minds of developers even when it isn’t actually useful for performance.  

So besides actual performance improvement, there is perhaps another good use of aligned values when defining magic numbers: they are effectively a coding convention, so if you are reading code with a defined value not following it or is just near one (e.g., like 257) it stands out in the code, maybe worth a further look as there could be a smell of an “off by one” error lurking or something else."

118sfhy,j9j11ac,83,"Yes, if HR hands me a resume that links a GitHub, I’m gonna look at it and consider it part of your application. It doesn’t need to demonstrate your full range of capabilities or be the most advanced stuff you’ve ever done, since a lot of your best stuff is liable to have been for previous employers. But it’s still an opportunity for you to demonstrate your current interests and expertise; and that makes it an excellent source of interview questions for me. That’s a way for you to exercise some control over the hiring process, so you should take advantage of that.

If your resume doesn’t mention a GitHub or a LinkedIn, then no. I’m probably not going to go sleuthing for your accounts because I have work to do. Although I can’t say my boss or someone in HR won’t go sleuthing as part of due diligence. At that point, though, we’d likely be confirming you were employable after we were confident we wanted to send an offer."

I’m sure you’ll occasionally get a hiring manager that will peruse it but it all really comes down to people’s bullshit meter."
118sfhy,j9jorwo,9,"I’d posit a guess that it depends on the domain/type of DS, job level, and stage of the application process where github may start to matter.

If the hiring manager has hundreds of resumes to leaf through, they’re probably not looking at 200 github repos. They may take their top N (say 10 or 20) and *then* look if it’s linked, and at that point, you’re just looking for *not bad code, but good code is a plus*. As in, bad code might break the application, but coachable-good code is fine, and exceptional code is a standout. However, if HR is screening resumes and only sending a handful to hiring managers, they may be more likely to look at them all.

i think it’s one of those situations where “it depends” is unfortunately always the answer. Based on the job level and domain - for an entry level role or internship, a github profile can help prove you can write code - but for the level of the job, some companies may simply not care to look at that or consider it a crucial part of your application.

At larger/more advanced companies for competitive mid-senior level jobs, especially tech companies that are more software-focused, the quality and track record of your code/contributing to open source may matter. But then again if you’re someone who qualifies for those roles, your track record probably speaks for itself.

I understand that answer was a wash, but here’s my two personal cents as someone who has been on the hiring side:
- many github repos you contribute to on the job are going to be private/proprietary. So other companies *can’t* see what you’ve done on the job.
- not everyone has the willingness or free time to be contributing to projects and extra work *outside of work*. Personally, I hate this expectation in the industry (if and where it exists) and don’t believe it should be held against people.
- given the first two points, I believe github should be a “nice to have for proving yourself, but absolutely not necessary for accepting a candidate” type of attribute in the hiring process."

118sfhy,j9kao4p,5,"Github repos have value in one of three scenarios:

1. When applying to roles straight out of school, where ALL your work should be personal work that can be freely posted on github

3. If applying to a role where you're expected to contribute to package/software development, and you can showcase open source projects you've contributed to.

If you're applying to a standard DS role with 2+ years of experience where you will be using mostly open source tools to train existing models on company data, then no - your guthub probably isn't very helpful in further you application too much.

Why?

Because the most important thing to evaluate for someone with 2 years of experience isn't what they can do technically in a mostly unconstrainted environment (i.e., whatever you decide to build based on absoutely no real-world requirements or stakeholders). What you are going to be evaluated on is ""did you produce results at your last job"".

I would say it is more important the closer your work is github-compatible e.g. if the company you are applying to produces open source software.

This has been the experience of practically everyone I know in or out of DS. It's a fact of life in a world where resumes get lost in a pile of a hundred ones that look identical to an HR person doesn't really know what to look for. You don't have much of a choice but to keep on trying, but you do have control over your relationship with rejection.

Take a hard look at your expectations - if they're too far out of line with the reality of the situation, it's going to contribute to feelings of depression. Instead of viewing this as a success or failure situation, think of it as trial and error. Don't look at rejection as a commentary on the abilities you already possess, but a mismatch between the ones you have and the ones they're looking for. It's not all that different than dating - rejection does not automatically mean you're unattractive or an unsuitable partner, it usually means that you didn't have enough in common for them to be interested.

It's hard to keep your head up when you're in the thick of it, but what else can you do? You have to play game if you want a job or significant other, and it's so much easier if you view it as some sort of pattern matching exercise than an exam where you have points to lose.

I got the job without actually applying for it, so all the external candidates got rejected because they preferred someone that already knows our data and has access to all the systems.

3. **Look for the proper vacancy.** Now that you know what you want, find it. LinkedIn, company websites, recruitment companies, etc - the method doesn't matter.
4. **Tailor your CV.** You know what you want, you know what you have and, from the job openings that you selectec previously, you know what you need. Highlight what you believe to be relevant, actually give details on what you did: ""Clustering project"" means nothing, but ""customer segmentation for X purpose"" gives more insight. Add technologies here, tasks that you are proud of, etc. *Make sure your CV addresses the requirements of the job postings*.

Largely because data science isn't really the sort of things that \*has\* entry level roles, the real entry level is data analyst unless you've got at least a masters if not a PhD in a quantitative field. 

As a hiring manager I would not look at someone who only had a bachelor's in data science, at least not for a data science role (I'd consider them for an analyst for sure). For one thing, that's a pretty new degree program so I'd have no idea what I'm getting. I'd rather see a CS, stats, or applied math degree than a data science specific one TBH.

It doesn't outline any traditional ML though, or absolute SOTA implementations of the algorithms. With the amount of information you're looking for, you'll likely need to find a recently published book.

118ybon,j9js2v6,1,"Unfortunately I’m not aware of a good comprehensive cheat sheet detailing all the SOTA advances and associated libraries. 

Here’s the thing about more complicated models - they often aren’t worth it. 

You should always be comparing models to a baseline - usually this means comparing to humble linear regression or some sort of tree model. You can do a pretty straightforward cost benefit analysis: determine how long it would take you to implement a new model (including learning time), add in the opportunity cost of potentially working on other projects in that time, and estimate the incremental improvement you would need to see for a new model to be worth it.

You also need to consider the other properties of your existing models. Are you willing to trade off the interpretability of a linear regression model for the black boxy, but more accurate model? 

This is really where domain knowledge and experience come into play."
118ybon,j9k0fll,1,"Typically I’ll use methods in an iterative fashion, with each released version as the baseline for the next one. So version 1 might be a heuristic that I construct with domain knowledge and ordinary analysis. For version 2, I’ll study v1’s shortcomings and try to improve upon those issues. That might mean making the heuristic more complicated, or I might swap it to a simple ML model if that seems appropriate. Repeat until it’s time to work on something else.

The choice of model doesn’t come down to how advanced it is or how popular it is. It’s about how applicable it seems to the task, how much effort it’ll be to use, and whether it’s likely to yield the specific improvements I want. Bonus points if it’s something we’ve successfully used before and can recycle the code."

I still can go with some SOTA stuff, if I want 1% more F1 score or whatever."
118ybon,j9mzr72,1,"The reality is that in nearly all cases you will never come close to using anything state of the art nor should that be where you even consider starting.  Often simple algorithms can offer a lot of value quick and provide a baseline to build upon.

I'd start with setting up a jupyter notebook and just start data exploration by connecting to it and describing it's structure and some statistics, functional overview of one reservior/monitoring session and from there getting into relations, high level analysis like grouping/ordering. Organize and describe all your steps and experiments so you and others can come back to it to reexperience the data exploration.

Next step is to describing your goals and prepare example cases that will later help you validate solutions. Now just experiment with different methods, libraries and datasets and again describe your steps. Refine this experiments into ready to use snippets and plan your functions. Your workbook now should have enough information so other people could start reading it blanco and after a few minutes feel confident they can answer the questions/reach the goals.

Final step is data engineering and optimization: design a schema for your analysis and load the data into it, perform error checking and sanitize the data, add indexes and if possible relations and have a table you can write information on your runs and result to. Now bring this all together in a new Jupyter workbook and you have a portable or publishable solution you can use to present your results and describe your methods."

Getting the data is usually more time intensive and important than running a few lines of code to make a model.  For a bunch of things ""auto ML"" is often good enough for Kaggle style problems. 

Software engineering skills/code maintainability probably end up mattering more. Same with knowing inferential methods in ML and statistics and/or things such as experimental design, model productionization, etc.

Kaggle might be a decent tie breaker for comparing interns, that's about it. It shows that you can write 100 lines of code and have them run.

The hardest is the competition, if someone says he/ she is a competition master/ grandmaster in Kaggle, ill give my hats to him/ her. Though there have been recent controversies about those who compete-for-a-fee services exposed by some members.

The others? Don't really matter much, as most of those who farm and are obsessed with rankings spam the board with self-promoting posts and plagiarize notebooks. The funny thing is that, most of these spammers have a lot in common if you look at their profiles, maybe a cultural thing? Dunno...

In fairness to Kaggle, it makes the modeling part even easier, it shields the members away from the data gathering, cleaning, and politics. But is also almost always the most important part, in the real world your datasets are almost never given to you on a silver platter, and you will not just focus on the modelling part, but you may even have to do a little of everything before you can actually even get to the modelling part.

11970ig,j9mm27f,5,"Few suggestions to try:

* Before you abandon Pandas, start by trying to see if you can solve your issues ""Even python sometimes fails to do what I need it to do."" You can try out these enhancing performance tips from pandas doc ([link](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/enhancingperf.html)).
* Staying in Python, there are many glowing reviews for [polars](https://www.pola.rs/). I'd try that next if the above step still doesn't solve your problem.
* Finally, if you do need to leave Python and you ""don't like R"", I'd recommend a cli SQL tool like [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/). Database will be a single, embedded file and performance is also 1 of its selling points if that's truly your bottleneck."
11970ig,j9lu1cx,4,"Rather than do the work in excel, use excel to create a ""mapping"" document. Make each tab a different column of your data.

For the data that needs to be cleaned put that in column A. And then put the cleaned version of that data in column B. Obviously this will grow over time as you encounter new bad data that needs to be cleaned. Basically all the data you see for that column in your dataframe put in column A of that tab and the cleaned version (even if identical) in column B.

Call column A the data variable name and column B the same with ""_cleaned"" or something.

Now, when you want to clean the data load your excel map file in and create a dataframe of that mapping. So I call them mp_varname (using my rather than df to show it is just my map) and then do a merge. This way in one merge (plus the prep work) the data is clean. You don't need to write a ton of code changing one data element into another - the map handles it all.

Bonus point - your excel sheet is now a living document of your data cleaning work. You might even in time be able to hand it over to your data engineering team (if one exists) to automate it before it gets to you. But having it as a document is also great as you can easily show your steps.

And if new bad data comes along you just need to add some rows to your mapping excel and it's sorted.

And yes, this is probably going to be 80%+ of the time you spend on work. The model code tends to be trivial by the time you have sorted your data out!"
11970ig,j9kyqyc,2,"80-90% of your time being spent on data cleaning is extremely common when you're working on your own. Companies have teams of people and the best ones devote a \*ton\* of time to creating a reliable data pipeline. 

I tend to work on my own or in very small groups. I find that Python and Excel is a reasonable combination if you don't have the support infrastructure required to create a reliable data pipeline. R isn't better for data cleaning than Python; it's strengths lie elsewhere. When you use Excel, you \*need\* to adequately document your changes and save the original. I haven't yet found a need for SQL, but that could be due to insufficient exposure. It requires a completely different internal conceptualization of how to work with data, and you still need to do work to get your data back into a flat file to analyze with statistical models.

I think that data engineering refers more to the tasks appropriate to companies with good infrastructure for data creation, so your process is data cleaning/pre processing. But I could absolutely be wrong, and the terms may not be fully defined yet.

A few notes:

* it may be valuable at some point to fully document your time on a project. I find that a lot of people fail to accurately remember just how tedious/complex the initial data cleaning process was, and then fail to budget sufficient time in the future projects. Documenting at least one project can serve as a useful reminder.
* data cleaning can be quite unpredictable. Sometimes the issues are easy, sometimes quite time intensive, and we don't usually do a good job teaching people to identify complex vs easy tasks... if it's even possible to do so.
* I try to think of data cleaning as a puzzle; reshaping and smoothing out the data into the appropriate format. It makes it more fun.
* check out [https://openrefine.org/](https://openrefine.org/).
* Organize organize organize. Git is designed for organizing your cleaning process.
* Document document document. Git also helps with this. 
* Replacing unreliable/nonsense values with the average is commonly done, but it not considered good statistical practice in general. It artificially reduces the noise in your data, and you need heroic assumptions to believe that your noise \*should\* be reduced. I strongly recommend that you replace those values with missing values, especially on the first pass. If you really want to replace them with averages, do so in your final analysis."

After that - repeat, more learning, another pet project. If the interest for ds didn’t fade and you continue to master ds skills, then probably you can start thinking really seriously about switching.
But my advice is don’t just abandon accounting entirely. If you worked in this field for some time you have something that a lot of more experienced data scientists lack - domain expertise. If you aim at not just becoming data scientist but at becoming a specialist on the intersection of fields of accounting and ds, you’ll probably be more successful.

118qp3l,j9jzeid,6,"There’s a domain knowledge aspect but it also is something that may be visible in your analysis of the time series. Additive seasonality means that there is a constant linear seasonal change ie “Every Tuesday the value goes up by 5”. This means the amplitudes of your de-trended series will be seasonally patterned and a consistent “height”. In the case of multiplicative seasonality the amplitudes will vary based on the value of the trend (multiplicative) ie “Every Tuesday the value goes up by a FACTOR of 5”. In other words as your trend component gets larger so does the seasonal effect (and vice versa). 

The formulas are: 

Additive: Xt = Trend + Seasonal + Random
Multiplicative: Xt = Trend * Seasonal * Random

So when looking at visual representation of the time series, even with no domain knowledge, you ought to be able to see if the seasonal amplitudes are consistent or varying with the trend component. That’s you best way to determine which is appropriate. 

All that said do be careful to ensure that what you are seeing as a seasonal component is in fact that and not volatility changes in the time series. Be sure to check you acf and pacf plots."

You get asked questions you can answer. You provide detailed proof with your answer. You can only get promoted by getting involved with the social aspect of your job. Your company loves you for just sitting where you are. Your experience (or the 'business logic') is portable - it works just the same in other companies."
118hqyp,j9h6u39,7,"You wouldn’t necessarily stay mid-level technically, but most companies have a career track that stays technical, where you become a lead on projects but don’t manage people.

If you mean, can you move “up” in your career, in a fully technical role?

Yes-ish..

But question is, do you really want juniors bossing you around, in 20 years, making twice your salary?"
118hqyp,j9j1k59,2,"Absolutely. In fact, I know folks at my previous job (a large insurance company) that were basically data analysts for 15 or 20 years. They never took any kind of managerial or leadership position, they just moved up the pay grade as an analyst.

This is especially useful in a very large legacy corporation. What winds up happening is you become a specialist in certain data sets. For example, back at my old job we always knew that if we had any questions regarding one of our claims databases that we would just call Debbie. Debbie had been working with that database for 15 years and knew everything about it. She knew what data sets fed into it and when, also what data sets that database fed. She knew every idiocracy about that system.

She was 100% remote before the pandemic and was basically in a position where she couldn't be fired. No one in the company knew as much about this data source, which was critical to the company's operation, as Debbie. There are a few other large data sources that were like that had their own subject matter experts.

In fact, this was actually one of the biggest challenges I had at my old job. I got promoted to senior analyst and moved to a team that was filled with folks who'd been there for 15 and 20 years. My SQL skills were as good or better than anyone else is there, and I had solid stats and python knowledge which none of them had.

However, the people on my team had such a deep knowledge of the various data sources that we were using that conversations almost made it sound like they were speaking in a different language. They threw around acronyms left and right and I'd have no clue what they were talking about. I think the newest person on that team other than me had been working for the company for 10 years. My senior had been working there for 30 years, and another senior had been working there for 20 years.  I had been there just over two years.

The only downside is that the knowledge that the seniors gained was very company specific. Not even industry specific, just specific to that company in those data sources. It would make it very hard for those folks to move laterally to another company and still have the same level of expertise.

In terms of pay, at my old company you could rise and pay grade to the equivalent of a senior manager and still be an analyst. Although, managers typically got twice the bonuses as non-managers."
118hqyp,j9i7s6a,1,"Mid level? Well, even if you don't upgrade your skills to the most extreme levels, just keep up with whatever's new that comes out, you will still advanced within the company. Once you are there for 10 years, 15 years, you start to be that guy that knows not just how everything works, but WHY it works like that. You'll be the guy with all the background infromation that a lot of people will want to talk to after being there for that long. Management will ask you to lead projects, and you pretty much know how everything works together, it will be just normal work for you.

So yeah, you're fine doing what you are doing, as long as you work hard enough to do a good job."
118hqyp,j9lcv96,1,"At some companies, you can follow an individual contributor (IC) track. My team has 6 levels for IC data analytics roles - I, II, II, Senior, Lead, Principal. Generally the top three levels are for folks with 5-10+ years of experience and advanced degrees. In the US, you can make $150k or more at these levels, especially in tech. You’ll mentor more junior folks or manage their work on a project but you won’t be a manager."
118hqyp,j9msw3y,1,">I definitely don't want to be in a position of leadership, nor do I want anything high stress.

Neither do many of us, until you realize getting passed down BS means even higher stress. Then you start fighting your way up and ~~force~~ influence others to use your methods and before you know it, you are a leader.

By year two you'd be up IT's ass about why some data always have issues and you'd want to implement change so you don't have to work 10-hr shifts to fix them. This jaded path is inevitable.

The good news is, as you move up, your salary also go up. Then there come a time where you don't mind no raise/a small pay cut if it means you avoid a lot of BS. That's your true equilibrium point."

2. SQL is a must
3. stats - probability and  central limit theorem are must knows.
4. There are many things to learn but don't try to learn it all at once; you will learn as you go. You are most likely not using calculus as a DA, but if a situation comes up where you need calculus, then you go ahead and learn calculus. This especially applies to python libraries.

Once you have these down, I would look more into ml algos. A simple ML algo is linear regression! Random forest, XGBoost, KNN,neural networks etc are more advance things you will need to know but if you can't simply analyze data then DS is out of the question."

You might have better luck using that terminology though. For what it’s worth, I’ve heard that a fair amount (definitely not most or all) of these algorithms are actually fairly simple, and much more related to domain knowledge than anything else. 

Anecdotally, I had a professor who claimed that he knew exactly one person that actually managed to algorithmically predict market movement, 55% of the time, under specific conditions. For that knowledge, a well known hedge fund paid him mid 9 figures per year. 

More generally, some of the smartest people you’ll ever meet with decades of experience in fields like statistics, applied math, operations research, etc. all usually try to do this at some point. Virtually none succeed (although maybe there’s some selection bias there)."

119h87h,j9mvg6g,17,"There are many things about stock that makes a lot of ML methods fail, and the danger lies in people thinking they know enough ML to make money and ended up getting seriously burned by it. Here are some example issues:

1. Non-stationarity: past performance does not guarantee future performance. Stock patterns change without notice and things that was working can easily fail. It's very hard to model statistics that change in a not so predictable way
2. Highly non-normal behaviors: extreme events tend to be way under-estimated in many traditional statistical models. In stocks, things can go to the moon or crash with way higher frequency that normal expectations. These low frequency events can make/break a portfolio. To even try to model this properly requires research level math.
3. Feedback mechanisms: the moment you find some winning strategy, someone may notice and the stock patterns will change. This also goes back to non-stationarity. It's a never ending game of cat/mouse
4. Non-independent samples: you can never know the true statistical power of any particular analyses because stocks can be highly correlated. It's not so easy to tease out something going with the market vs some non-market specific movements.
5. Stochastic nature: unlike pictures of cats/dogs, stock movements have stochastic nature built-in. So not only do you have to quantify movements you also need to quantify risks. But modeling stochastic processes is hard, even harder when it is non-stationary, and basically impossible when it is non-stationary and contains potential feedback mechanisms.

I would start with more conventional geostatistical models.

The simplest of course would just be raster on raster regression, useful as baseline.

From there I would move on to geoadditive modeling strategies, incorporating a spline on the sphere intercept term, and then spline on the sphere coefficients for the rasters. These give a spatially varying version of the standard linear regression that accommodates for varying geographic characteristics in different portions of the globe. 

With all that said and done, if my results are still inadequate, then I would start to incorporate some additional non-local information by considering globe rotations and /or convolutions of the globe with a simple gaussian kernel as additional covariates."
118mnf4,j9indqs,2,"It seems like a weird but interesting problem. If I understand you correctly, you need to predict a daily average (or other statistic) from a 4 hour sample, so the output is just the average when including the other 20 hours?
Anyway, I would try concatenating the 4 time periods into a 1760x880x4 matrix and inputting that into a CNN. You can also concaténate different weather variables as they might be correlated with the output, it would be interesting to know if they improve the results.
BTW, you should compare the model metrics against using the naive estimation (E.g the average of the 4 periods), I think for many variables it should be a decent estimator."

Also it doesn’t matter what you’ve learned up to this point, your new coworkers will have their own way of building things that’s completely unique and obviously awful. And yes, they’ll be aware of that fact; but the code will run well; so they can’t justify rewriting it this year; so you’ll have to just learn their patterns and make improvements as you’re able.

Try your reasonable best to understand the math. Not to the extent that the data scientists might, but be able to recognize common patterns and calculations. Data scientists like to work in a bubble where everything magically works, but then they get to production and realize they can’t run their cubic-time ubermodel because production doesn’t run on a 500-core supercomputer and can’t spend ten hours on one real-time request.

If your long term goal is to remain a data scientist, then switching to BI will stunt some of those career opportunities. It's not impossible to pivot back by any means, but the experience you accumulate working in BI will not count 1:1 to experience you would have accumulated in DS.

My take is all skills have a half life, but the nature of the skill determines that half life. That also, the half life of a skill affects its weight on compensation: shorter half life=higher comp, longer half life=lower comp. Also where the skill is in terms of its half life weighs on comp as well.

They are all combined into your quiver of current skills and your current comp is a reflection of the half life position of them.

Example - soft skills like public speaking have very long, generational half lives. But you aren’t necessarily going to get a super high paying tech job on your public speaking skills alone. Even if you do, you comp will wane over time if your other skills aren’t there. On the other hand, having a fresh functional skill in the newest programming language or framework will have a very short half life, but likely pay extremely well."
118j392,j9hj21t,1,"Look at it this way. What's a promotion? It's generally taking on more responsibility. More responsibility for projects, for other people, for how a team works, etc, etc.

At entry level, the expectation is that you're able to do a good job on a task you're given with some supervision. Then you become mid level and the expectation is that you do a good job on the tasks you're given without any supervision. At senior level you're going to be expected to lead projects or workstreams (possibly involving others), contribute to planning / ways of working / team strategy etc, and probably be menotring less experienced colleagues.

Coding, analytical, and statistical skills are great for the first two levels. That's what gets you these positions. But without the ""softer skills"" you mention above, you're going to start seriously stalling as you look to move to senior -> management, etc.

Most poeple pick this stuff up along the way. Good managers help a lot but having this attitude that you need to improve on this stuff and being to open to learning is the key I think. It's largely about experience."

2. Great technically - this means being able to handle complex problems reasonably well. This doesn't necessarily mean using the most complicated techniques. It also often means that your work is maintainable/scales and interfaces well with other systems.

A great Data Scientist will understand the business issues, and will find out how data (and what data) can be used to help solve that problem. More often than not the solution is about finding the right data which nobody thought of using, or how to present the result of an analysis. I would certainly not said that the difference is an in depth expertise of latest ML techniques in a non academic environment.

117j74m,j9byuh8,22,"Poisson (fun fact means fish in French) dist can be [derived](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~pollard/Courses/241.fall97/Poisson.pdf) by considering the case when the binomial has very small p and very large n. The intuition for the poisson would be waiting for a rare process among many whereas the binomial is waiting for a possibly not so rare process among relatively few. Something like watching traffic for car wrecks would be poisson while rolling dice would be binomial

The exponential dist can be [derived](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-exponential-distribution-7bdd08590e2a) as the waiting time pdf between subsequent poisson events, so how long between the car wrecks? Notice this theoretically shouldn’t depend on whether there has or hasn’t been a car wreck recently so the exponential distribution is *memoryless* in fact so is the geometric distribution and the exponential can be thought of as a continuation of the geometric too…

Most beginning statistical inference or intermediate probability theory texts should have these derivations, in particular Casella Berger has them

All together there isn’t one way to look at this either, the connections between probability distributions is a difficult and extensive [subject](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationships_among_probability_distributions)"
117j74m,j9e1spr,2,"Look at Casella and Berger *Statistical Inference* for starters. I'm not sure which books you're reading, but most serious statistics texts (including Casella and Berger) will construct the Poisson distribution as a limiting form of the binomial distribution. If you read Resnick's Adventures in Stochastic Processes, he constructs the Poisson distribution as a sum of independent Bernoulli random variables.

The exponential distribution can be naturally constructed using stochastic processes as a continuous waiting time model. Other constructions are available, and Wikipedia describes a few of them."
117j74m,j9c0or6,3,"Short answer why there is so many Euler numbers - it’s an eigenfunction of a derivative (a functional in terms of functional analysis) and so just like with matrices you can have invariants. By exploring invariants in the PD equations you then get the specific solution. Secondly, since it’s we are working with uncountable base, you necessarily have to have unsolvable and with multiple solutions sets of equations (from category theory you can even derive that set of uniquely solvable equation sets is strictly smaller then non-uniquely solvable) - for specific condition look up Cauchy-Kovalewskaya theorem, Carathèodory theorem, or more manageable for someone less familiar with math - Picard-Lindelöf. So this all combined gives you those Euler functions since you can calculate eigen functions of both poisson and exp equations and they all are basically ~e^x, e^x^2 (simplifying for clarity). In general I suggest some level appropriate book about PDE/university script since anything informal will have excessive amounts of hand-waving"

117mey6,j9cte97,10,I finished a masters in applied statistics from Penn State and was hired immediately after as a statistician for two years. Then I was hired as a data scientist out of that role.
117mey6,j9d5ho1,15,"> I have also been looking at DS Master's programs but heard maybe it's still best to avoid those for now.

The quality of data science masters really depends from school to school. Imo, it's better to do a master's in data science from a good program than to do a master's in stats/CS from a shitty program, and vice versa.

I did a master's in data science that was offered through a statistics department. The stats department where I got my master's also offered a MS in Stats where at least 60-75% of the requirements were identical (literally the exact same courses) to the MS in Data Science, and students in both programs took many of the same electives. The main difference was that the data science master's required a few courses from the CS department, whereas the MS in Stats did not. I took most of my electives in the CS and linguistics departments and focused on NLP, so my current work is mostly NLP stuff.

The program helped me a lot because I was finally able to get a formal course in all the theory behind statistical learning. I knew some of it when I was trying to self-learn ML, but being in an actual class with grades on the line certainly makes a difference lol. In addition, the CS courses really helped a lot and I am much more knowledgeable in parallel/distributed computing, which is really useful when you are dealing with huge datasets. 

It was also finally good to get that master's credential on my resume, which probably boosted my application profile for some hiring managers."

Interesting but sadly a bit irrelevant in the field of BI consulting. Seems that in my situation getting the degree itself is what counts. Career-wise I would definitely encourage most people to pursue a masters though. At least here in Europe it seems that the degrees are what gets you in the door initially, while your interests determine what you’ll end up working with, assuming the organization(s) you work for allows you to traverse laterally without much hassle. From then on you’ll be hired mostly for your qualifications and work experience anyway

11714te,j99kyis,76,"This is entirely normal in all of the analytical teams that I've worked in/with.

Analysts focus on getting results. Good programming practices, like testing and validation, are neither implemented or encouraged.

A direct consequence is that many results are just plain wrong."
11714te,j9alkrm,14,"I think what you described is pretty normal, and as an MLE, I also hate it: Lack of documentation makes onboarding and orientation a nightmare. Lack of tests makes reproducibility harder and slows down refactoring. Almost every experiment seems to have at least one false start due to some silly bug.

But as I have gained experience, I’ve started to at least understand why things are this way, if not approve of it.

A part is that I think lots of people in the analytics space never studied CS, so the importance of automation and good coding practices was never really instilled in them. Then again, I also never studied CS nor SWE, and I definitely see the value in its principles. So 🤷

But the biggest factor IMHO is that for all the benefits of documentation, tests, tidy code, etc., that stuff does introduce significant up front costs which slow you down at first. In the world of experiments and exploratory analysis, you have lots of little one-off needs and must iterate quickly through the space of possibilities in order to identify the promising ones. So while it’s a bummer for the uninitiated to get acclimated to messy code, in the end it’s usually just faster to make small tweaks and roll with it, rather than tweak, document, push, PR, etc.

The other thing to consider is that things like thorough documentation and testing are most critical when your code base will definitely persist and continue to undergo development for a while. But in the worlds of data science and machine learning, many lines of research - most with their own bespoke model classes, training and eval scripts, preprocessing pipelines and dataset loaders, etc. - ultimately never bear fruit, so get dropped. For such work strands, any time spent documenting and testing was 100% wasted. So when you’re in that initial experimentation phase on the road to deciding whether to pivot or persist, the cost-benefit of taking time to write docs and tests is probably not worth it.

So yeah, in conclusion, I do think everybody’s life would be better and fewer false results would occur if everyone just adopted proper coding discipline. But doing so is not without drawbacks in the world of exploratory research, mostly in terms of productivity. So as always, it’s just a trade-off."
11714te,j99kmj7,8,"At least on the commercial side, this is completely normal.

Code review. Do it."
11714te,j9anlzk,6,"High-performing teams have detailed code reviews. This is the bare minimum. Even if they have some excuses for why they don’t have documentation or testing in place (which will almost all be bad excuses imo), you _must_ review each other’s code.

Maybe I’ve been lucky with the teams I’ve worked on so far, but I’m alarmed by the number of people in here saying they have no code review practice on their team. I can see this being more common for analytics/SQL work (not that I agree with it), but it would be insane to ship an ML model without review.

No review/testing/etc is absolutely the norm in academia in my experience. The open code/data movement is helping here, but most fields have a long way to go. At least in academia you have many groups trying to study the same things, so if your paper makes a claim but the code had a catastrophic bug, it will likely be caught eventually if it doesn’t make sense in the context of everyone else’s work. That’s my take from my experience in physics anyway. YMMV."

117si3k,j9j9rdt,1,"I recently had a discussion with a hiring manager in a data analytics team at a large company, and what he said kinda pertains to this.

He said that in the past 5-7 years, TONS of software engineers have transitioned to a data science/analytics role without going back to school to get the proper statistics/calculus/theoretical training. The result was this: A bunch of companies desperate for DS talent hired these individuals because of their past work experience, and what happened was predictable - many of these individuals lacked the theoretical knowledge to make any truly groundbreaking insights beyond what their cookie-cutter models spit out.

The consequences are unfolding now: data science roles are drying up as managers are realizing that *good* data scientists are actually quite hard to come by, and that many people applying for these roles just don't have the deep statistics knowledge required to drive actionable insights. Sure they can design ML systems in Python or R, but they can't interpret the results nor can they augment their models in meaningful ways. 

As such, data analyst and data engineer roles are booming: the trusted data scientists are still working, but they're leaving the analysis to the more recent graduates with better statistics backgrounds, but yet aren't quite at the ""pure data scientist/ML engineer"" level. 

But what's really going crazy right now is data engineering, where SWE and cloud engineering skills are often much more quickly transferrable. The need to store and process and pipeline data will never go away, but finding those with deep stats knowledge for the DS roles is becoming harder as hiring standards go up. 

So if you're looking to enter the real ""data"" world just understand that your options are to either:

1. Work towards becoming an analyst, which requires some decent statistics knowledge but nothing graduate-school level.

2. Transition to data engineering or data ops, which will require less theoretical academic knowledge, but will require some certifications re: infrastructure.

3. Work towards becoming a data scientist/ML engineer, which will require *considerable* effort training yourself and going deep into statistics, logic, and machine learning theory."

For long data, each row is a serial number-wavelength combination. You have a lot of rows with the same serial number. 

It's far from perfect, because you end up with a lot of extra space with redundant/blank information. But it's the best solution I've seen so far for storing multidimensional data in a flat/tabular format.

I'm a graduate about to get their masters (maths) from a good university. I'm currently applying for entry level DA and software development positions with the ultimate goal to become a data scientist.

I've got advice on this sub to focus on explaining the mathematics behind machine learning methods. My focus at university has been algebra although I have done (this includes in formal courses and demonstrated through projects) extensive work with algorithms, Markov chains, complex systems (including programming and analysis using statistics) and very basis data analysis (quantitative and qualitative). I've also done external verifiable courses in SQL and Python.

The issue is that I'm struggling to get my foot in the door. A lot of DA positions want 1+ year of experience (to clarify, I've only applied to entry level jobs, i.e. job listings containing the word ""entry"") and on the ones that don't, if they ask about salary expectations I've gone towards the lower end of the range (we are talking near minimum wage in my country) and yet I've just flat out been rejected every time.

For software development I've done one video interview (went awfully, I'm really awkward during video interviews and often mess up/forget what I want to say) and I've got a weird exam to attend in the future but I fear it's going to be the same result.

Using Python's geography-related libraries, draw a map showing how far you are from France at any given location in the world, or, if you're inside France, how far you are from the nearest non-France point (this is sometimes called a ""signed distance"" map).

As part of this project, you could find the point furthest from France (and, if that point happens to be on water, the land point further from France) and perhaps even the point most inside France.

Pretend you’re a delivery manager. You have a single truck that needs to make a series of deliveries, but can only go 400 miles before it runs out of gas. It would be very useful to know the most number of deliveries a truck can make before it needs to stop for gas.
You could do some cool visualizations with Google maps and have a nice little dashboard where you could tweak mileage and/or delivery locations. If you wanted to make it really fancy you could start incorporating multiple trucks and create a whole optimized logistics network tool.

Just the risk of data ending up on a laptop is enough to justify it without all the productivity gains which are substantial. 

If you want to try GCP, get some free credits, get a jupyter notebook in Vertex Workbench, get some data and play. Remember to shut things down. 

Their no code AutoML and feature store are pretty expensive. So go easy on that.

If you are working on solely GCP it’s likely there is a high level of DS maturity where things are standardised and made form scale. So this is likely a good thing, you will be working to best practice not ad hoc playing around. 

While there are some no/low code options in GCP they’re not really for data science teams. They are useful for DS times at times but again if you are solely in a cloud with data science tooling, you’re in a good spot, this stuff is expensive, they’ve made an investment in tooling.

My sincere suggestion is to tell them you will create an ensemble model that contains your solution mixed with the ChatGPT solution, which is superior to ChatGPT by itself.

Just give them logical arguments, and don't push back for no reason.

Sales meetings in NYC, Baltimore.

Client conference in Orlando.

Trade conferences in NYC and San Francisco, including chairing panel discussions. 

Overseas client engagement to Stockholm and other cities in Sweden.

Campus recruiting at Stanford University.

1-2x a month commutes to Boston over a 2 year period when working for a start-up.

That is over a 25 year span.  It helps to work for a large corporation.  And I had very little travel requirements when my kids were young which was nice.  I feel like business travel is not so much a hassle when you don’t get burned out on it in your 20s and 30s. 

I sometimes would book additional days on my own dime for fun stuff like skiing at Heavenly or Killington, or a day at the museums in NYC, or the beach in California. 

Best travel stories:

Upgrading to business class for $59 and then saying hello to a friend who was tiered 2 levels above me while we were both at Capital One.  He was like “WTF you get first class?”  and I gave him the classic “Max on the back of the sleigh shrugging his shoulders and waving to the Grinch” as the mass of humanity pushed him back to coach.  

One time I settled into my window seat and a younger, attractively and professionally dressed woman stuffs her gear into the overhead and takes the aisle seat beside me.  I tell her, without making eye contact, “we’ve got to stop meeting like this.”  She took one look at me and yelled “u/wil_dogg, what the hell how are you!!” turned out to be another COF friend who had moved on to a great career at Merkle. It was a nice time to catch up.

Worst travel experiences:

Re-routed to Vegas on an redeye, needing a room for 3 hours, then luggage delayed and needing to buy clothes in Salt Lake City, and then having the cost of the clothes declared as income that I am taxed on (company covered the clothes bill, it was necessary to be ready to interview job candidates).  With that said, Southwest gave me a $450 voucher that I used to take my twin daughters skiing at Killington.

Not paying enough attention at Boston Logan and missing my evening flight, thus requiring an overnight stay.   Fortunately the gate attendant didn’t charge me anything for the rebooking. 

Travel Hero:

Flight out of Madison WI in February.  Evening departure and the pilot tells us “ok, when we are just leaving the runway you are going to hear the engines whine and the pitch of the jet will be wild and it is going to be one of the bumpiest rides you have ever taken, there are high winds at about 100 feet to 500 feet, but all cool so just be ready.   Well I had already chatted with my new friend in the aisle seat, turns out she worked in museum archiving and knew of VMFA, my home museum, but had never visited Richmond. Well, also turned out she did not like flying at all, so this was not going to be fun for her.  So I told her about landing in similar conditions at O’Hare, that these pilots know their stuff, and if holding hands helps or she needs to grab my arm just go for it.  Yes, it did help.  Having had women grab my arm when a flight got rough I knew that is a normal response.  It was nice to be a helper when it mattered.

Oh last fun story — meeting a fellow Richmonder at Logan, she had a BIG companion dog, like a white Kuvasz, she has epilepsy and the dog can sense her pre-seizure events and that would prompt her to take meds / self-care and avoid a seizure.  I invited her to sit with me at Legal Seafood when there were no seats, her doggo was great, and then we were able to sit together on the flight.  We arrived at RIC late evening and my wife was picking me up so we were able to give her a lift to her place in the Fan on the way home, saving her some time and money."

This person had even left documentation, but once it broke we realized there were issues and couldn't figure out how to resolve them.

Data scientists are not engineers and not many have been exposed to good coding practices. This statement isn’t universal of course, but from my experience as an engineer I’ve noticed data scientists don’t write a very good code. This is because the nature of work is more analytical and data science teams are often distanced from production environments where code maintainability, testability, readability, modularity, reusability etc. are important.

A simple start would be to ensure everyone uses git. seen so many data scientists that still share their. ode through emails, slack messages etc.

to improve coding practices you can get pre-commit hooks that run automatic linting (e.g. pylint + black formatter). it will automatically detect poor practices and will prevent from poirly written code to being commited to the code base. Alao it has automatic formatting of the code and it will ensure that code is formatted to a standard. 

This approach works really well, because 
- the feedback is objective as libters will highlight what rule is violated
- people can get defensive if other people are  orrecting the code. Now code is being reviewed by a spftware
- this is done automatically within few miliseconds
- you won’t have trivial arguments during code reviews about formatting, poor variable names etc. you can focus on reviewing the logic and methodology


What you are essentially trying to do is to change engineering culture. This is not easily achievable. Becoming better at coding to follow beet practices requires discipline and have an open mind. In my experience this is particularly tricky with experienced engineers (+5 yoe) because “we have always done it this way” and they think it is waste if time. What these people don’t realise is that time is wasted much more in the future when someone else inherits the code and tries to understand what is going on or fix a bug."

115grbp,j91l6uj,54,"The general rule of thumb I've heard is that you want to be making 50-100% more as a contract versus full time.

That is because of sacrificing health benefits, vacation time, job security, professional development, and potentially large tax liabilities.

The new hourly rate is only ~20% more than your current, which you could probably get just by finding another full-time role that still has all the benefits and job security.

The only reason I would take this is if you are really looking to job hop frequently to get a lot of different experience and network.  Or perhaps build a client roster for when you start your own company."
115grbp,j91vpbp,15,"Because of the lack of benefits, lack of friction in releasing you, and other things, I typically recommend only considering contract work if you are currently unemployed or the expected pay is twice what you now make over that time period. The advantage to an employer is tremendous in these situations.   
I also notice that you stated that they expected you come to the office three days a week. I'm pretty sure that is illegal for them to require of the 1099 independent contractor in the US. The problem there is if you bring it up, they'll just decide to terminate your contract, as it is likely written highly in their favor as well.    
I often recommend contract to hire positions for people who are currently looking for a job, but almost never to people who currently have one."
115grbp,j91hkg2,3,"Does this include health insurance?  Typically, a contractor doesn't get all the benefits of an FTE.  If there are benefits you want, then it's out of your pocket,  so ask for more money.   1099s usually don't get paid vacation,  sick time, etc.  This may not matter to you. 

Best thing is contractors are usually outside of office politics and company meetings."
115grbp,j92pzjs,3,"Just because it’s contract doesn’t mean it’s 1099 btw. Contract you typically have no benefits or benefits through the staffing company if they offer it (usually worse or expensive, ymmv of course). Since the company hiring you doesn’t have to pay for your benefits, they can normally pay you a hire rate. $85/hr converts to $176,800/yr before taxes not including overtime pay. It’s really up to you if this extra money outweighs the benefits."
115grbp,j91u5c0,2,"I think that the tangible, quantifiable pieces that you can adjust that contract rate for are:

* insurance
* Pto
* 401k match
* Taxes

Like, you should be able to figure out how much more you'll be paying extra because of all that.

As a rule of thumb, Ive heard a good estimate of the cost to go from monetary comp to fully loaded employee cost is 20 to 25%. So I would say no, 20% is not worth leaving a FT role for."
115grbp,j928rgd,2,"Having done contract work, once, don’t do it. You have literally zero protections, any benefit is going to be expensive, if offered. 

As other have said, if you are unemployed… that’s ok, otherwise stay full time. Temps are used as buffer, sometimes they convert,’ sometimes they don’t. You are a full time employee, you proven your worth to be full time. 

6 months is a “trial run” which puts too much risk for little money."
115grbp,j92bx6d,2,"Thank you, all! Considering your comments, I have decided not to pursue the contract-to-hire position."
115grbp,j93ec5k,2,"$85/hr is barely above $150k (approx 1,800 work hrs in a year, 150 hrs/month -> gives $153k in your case). IMO, it's silly that you are even considering this with such high salary and stability that FT perm provides + medical + dental + stat holidays, etc.

General rule for contract/consulting work: annual FT salary / 1000 is what one should be getting per hour. E.g. $150k FT perm salary -> $150/hr approx contract rate for the exact same work.

P.S. Consulting/contract tech work is not what most people outside of it think of it - IMO it's worth it for the most part - based on my experience and what I've seen around.

Hope this helps."
115grbp,j926yp2,1,"Personally, I don't like 1099 work because it puts you on the hook for more taxes and having to deal with withholdings. 

You would likely want to have an accountant or be confident on how much you'd need to withhold and do that stuff ahead of time to not be on the hook for a lot of taxes at the end of the year. 

The other thing ends up being there is a reason folks don't do consulting or freelance or short-term data science work like other software engineering positions mostly because in most cases you need someone with a lot of subject matter expertise, which means your onboarding will be at a minimum a month or 6 weeks. 

IMO you are inherently a much riskier hire to them. So you risk spending two months just learning the ropes and not adding value then deciding to leave with just wasted time. If this is an area that you want to continue doing data science in then maybe it would be worth it to learn the subject matter but if this isn't an area you are interested in or want to continue in then consider how much value you'd get. I also think odds are if they really wanted to hire a full-timer they wouldn't do a contract to hire. It's a more scummy approach and they miss out on quality candidates. Plus of course, the risk that they let you go for anything then you can't collect unemployment since in quite a few states being a contractor bars you as the company doesn't pay any taxes on you. 

Depends on where you are with things really, if you need the work do it; the market is in shambles even on the senior level but it'll be a very not ideal setup."
115grbp,j92ogq5,1,Contract to hire is the norm in several US cities where the city's employer culture is outsourcing hiring to staffing agencies.

The second is data analyst. This role is more about answering business questions like why did revenue go down and how do we make it go back up or how do we forecast something. Data analysts use everything from excel, PowerPoint, SQL, tableau, PowerBI, Python, R, etc. Some jobs only use excel while other are going to be using some ML. It depends on the organization.

Here is what I will tell everyone pursuing a graduate degree - the better the degree, the more you will have the leverage to sidestep bad scenarios.

If you get a MS in Analytics from a top 50 program you will have a different experience than if you get a MS in CS from Stanford. There is literally no way around that.

Those who say ""I don't want to just crunch numbers for a company to make more money"" - excellent, but that means you either need to sacrifice comp and/or you need to go become one of the top 5% in the field.

You probably want to target ML Engineer jobs, or DS jobs where you work on production code."
115g14e,j923d08,1,"When I graduated with my engineering degree, I was excited to go out and design new things. When I got my first engineering job, I found the work to be really mundane - I was basically just taking things that already existed, figuring out how to connect them together, and make sure the drawings were updated. It wasn't really *engineering* work. I realized that universities were pumping out so many engineers that there was a huge surplus, and most engineers who obtained only a bachelor's degree were doing work that could easily be done by a technologist. Decided to go back for at least a Master's to have a shot at having an interesting career.

I feel like DS is getting there now. If you want an interesting job, there are no shortcuts. If you take the same streamlined path as most people going into DS right now, you're going to be competing with *them* and will probably end up with a job at one of those ""I guess we should start doing data science???"" companies, if at all.

i used to be in fraud prevention, and dealing with this kind of thing is a headache, mostly because we do not have good labels. fraudsters are not volunteering that they are committing fraud, and heuristic rules to label events as likely fraudulent are going to be more or less problematic. 

&#x200B;

 the answer to your particular question depends on the model and data volume. if you have a tree-based model and can feed in all the data at a time, then i don't think this necessarily presents a huge issue. if you have e.g. a logistic regression model and can only train on a bit of data at a time, well, that sucks.

And look for batch API’s for each site before crawling it, because the batch API will always work better and will be designed to handle your requests. This is especially important if your crawler is distributed because a large cluster can easily overwhelm a small website."

The visa issue really is a sticking point and the vast majority of companies won't help. I only saw one advert explicitly stating that it would help secure a visa. The second thing to know is that most of the jobs are hybrid in London, and even a good salary won't stretch far when it comes to housing/transport/childcare.

114sprj,j8xuyqa,3,I would definitely opt for using R/Python depending on which you’re most comfortable with. The main steps of your process will be clearly outlined in a range of online tutorials and then you’ll just have to tweak things to fit your use case. For PhD research I can’t imagine a low-code solution being a viable option and at some point you may be required to build custom packages/libraries. It may seem more daunting at first but if you go low-code then you’ll likely have to implement lots of hacky behaviour if you want anything mildly bespoke. Check out sklearn or tidymodels and see if they fit with what you think you need for the project.
114sprj,j8yhsk7,3,"I think in 2023, anyone who wants to pursue a career as a quantitative social scientist needs to know at least R or python, ideally both. It is highly unlikely that whatever cutting edge algorithm is ideal for your project at the time you start your dissertation (it will be years from when you start your program and the data science landscape could be totally different by then) will be something you can utilize through a browser-based GUI or whatever. If you refuse to learn code you are essentially making it impossible for yourself to technically innovate on anything occurring in this space. 

For what it's worth, I started a PhD program with 0 computer science background and the tasks of learning how to code and use ML models would probably not make my list of top 5 challenging problems I had to deal with during my studies. Some programs will even teach you this stuff as part of standard curriculum - my opinion is that the programs that are not doing so are failing their students."
114sprj,j8xynil,2,"I would advise against KNIME. It's not as easy as it looks at first sight and it's a nightmare to debug/ maintain.

I would suggest to fresh up your knowledge in R or Python, this makes much more sense."
114sprj,j8xzxmu,2,"I'm not an expert in KNIME, but most of the applications I've seen are for data pipelines (queries, joins, aggregations, copies) not modeling.  I would be a little cautious about its modeling capabilities - if it can truly give you the tools and flexibility you need."
114sprj,j8yd5rc,2,"Hi, Poli sci PhD here. At this point, most (American) programs use R, a few holdouts still use STATA, and there will sometimes be a class that uses Python. LSE is an R shop as well, at this point. 

In a PhD, you'll usually have (minimum) 3 classes of quantitative coursework (probability, GLMs, and causal inference), which will involve a decent amount of stats. This is the case even if you have a qualitative research agenda in mind. These courses will provide a lot of the knowledge you need for the average dissertation, and you can probably take more classes if you need it.

Quite frankly, if you use a no-code solution, no one will take you seriously on the market. Additionally, with the push for replication in journals, if you can't provide reproducible scripts, it'll hamper your chances of getting published."
114sprj,j907p7a,1,"Use knime, it's great low code and helps organize your thought process, like others have said though r and python will be useful, and you can run r and python in knime, in fact I've ran into situations where you need to code in knime, or at least I couldn't figure out a node situation for the problem. Knime is great! Computational Social Science is Data Science, all the researchers who study complexity and information science in academia created the tools that data scientists and analysts use in industry."
114sprj,j9oc4ze,1,"I would go against using python for your use case, if your current goal is to assess the value ML can create. Think of it like if you want to compare a new type of a pizza, you can go out and try it, if you like it you can try other restaurants doing the same thing. If you really require to make it better or serve it to others, then you can learn how to prepare one by yourself.

As a former data scientist, I would say building a machine learning model consists a lot of steps, which is quite easy if you have been doing it already for a lot of times, but when starting fresh you would encounter a lot of small roadblocks which is not directly related with your original purpose. Things like how to read files, how to manage missing values, understand algorithm's parameters and build models for them, how to plot some outputs etc etc. These steps are trivial for experienced data scientists as they accumulate a scar tissue while building / managing machine learning projects, but can be time consuming and waste of resources if you want results quickly. 

Technology is there to solve business problems. In my experience teaching how to use no code tools, people with analytical mindset can easily grasp the idea and use it according to their need. And if they want get their hands dirty, they can always switch to coding and go to lower levels as the problem requires."

I would caution against the idea of trying to predict A/B performance instead of running the A/B test. Your test set performance should be a good enough prediction of your production performance.

113x0sh,j8xsa3s,3,">I have submitted 52 applications to data scientist (with more analytics focus) and data analytics positions and have interviewed at 7 of the companies

Two takeaways from this:

1. 7 interviews out of 52 applications is pretty good
2. If you're not moving past the interview stage, then odds are you need to improve your interviewing skills.

This is what I always tell people:

* If you're not getting screening interviews (with recruitersor first conversations with hiring managers), it's because your resume needs to be better (and that may mean you need to actually do more things in real life for your resume to improve).
* If you're getting to that interview stage, but you're not getting offers, it's going to be because you're not interviewing well or because you lied/exaggerated on your resume. 

If you've gotten 7 interviews, it means people are looking at your experience and saying ""yeah, that's what I need"". But after they are talking to you, they're walking away saying ""eh, something about this candidate isn't working for me"".

My advice - especially if you have someone you can lean on for this: practice interviews with another person. Try to take notes of the structure of the interviews you've had so far and the questions they have asked you, and answer them for someone else and get their feedback.

With 3 years of experience, yes - the market is soft right now, but I think there's still pretty strong demand for people with 2+ years of experience."

1148t81,j8v4xe9,2,"A good first step might be to develop the pipelines to get the data from the source to the server/platform/warehouse you'll be interacting with it. You have a voice in that and you should use it.

I'm in a similar position to you, where I'm the only DS at a ~150 person company. We have great data for me to work with, and the culture is very data positive, but when I started I ran into a lot of issues because the company who managed our data warehouse sucked. My workflow was severely restricted because I was using a shoddy API they'd developed to query data that had all these bizarre restrictions on it.

After a while I realized that I could voice my dissatisfaction about this and influence the process. We're working with a second company now that has much more modern methods and it's great. Still, I started noticing issues with the data and took it to them. They said that someone on our end told them to process the data that way, but we agreed it was not a good process and changed it. So I learned that I need to be in those meetings where people are discussing the pipelines. Then, once the data is in your hands in the way that you want, you can finally do data sciencey stuff to it."

AI tools are going to be amazing and are going to replace some jobs, transform some jobs, etc. but talking about the 'future being bleak for data scientists' is just not a strong prediction.

Positions that focus on designing new CV and NLP models are going to become increasingly rare because relatively few companies have the data or funding necessary to train those kinds of models, let alone invent new ones.

The field will be fine. It just won’t be like it was in the 2010’s where every DS was a superstar making $200k. The role is going to be commodified and democratized like software development was, and the job title is going to become far more accessible."

If you need to compare every feature to every other feature, then you flatly have to calculate n(n-1) comparisons. Anything you do that is correct is going to perform at least that much work, whether it’s nested for loops or not. If you can parallelize/distribute the calculation, then you can build one big list of pairs of features, and process multiple comparisons in parallel; and that’ll give you a proportional speedup.

Are you sure that this is the correct starting point, though? To me, it seems like an odd thing to calculate. I’m not sure the result will be as informative as you’d like, and for most datasets it’d be difficult to visualize the result in a way that revealed any actionable patterns."

An even better approach would be to use sliding windows within scaffold/chromosomes instead of looking for correlations between genes independently.

You can also check data types of df[I] and df[e] in the loop and apply the correct statistical method. Like if you need to use chi square for two categorical variables for example you would want to split your data frame into categorical variables only first then do a cross tab on that data before looping. Then do a loop for each type of variable comparison. So I will sometimes have 3 splits of my data frame, continuous v continuous, categorical v categorical, and categorical v continuous.

In this step, you should be looking for potential multicollinearity between independent variables, rather than statistical significance. When building a statistical model, you want to ensure you are minimizing collinear independent variables. Otherwise, you might have problems with result interpretation and model fit.

Instead of asking how you can do what you’ve asked, you should ask yourself whether it’s the right approach. As others have alluded to, not understanding why you are doing something and if it’s the correct approach will not only waste your time but also lead to bad science."

Do all that via python or via the AWS CLI. Then run some descriptive queries to summarize table(s) in the DB you created. Pull a subset down and run some models against it. All that will be a good set of learning experiences. 

Maybe use a Kaggle competition that interests you as the base for all of the above, just to get you semi-structured data to use and a goal to orient towards. Or use data from your PhD.

It's much more of a general SQL exam than a Oracle specific exam.

Next get a decent level of proficiency with tableau. You may want to consider picking up one of the tableau certifications.

Don't worry about Rstudio or anything like that. The jobs that you are looking for are jobs that have SQL and Tableau in their requirements. If you found Tableau boring you may want to switch over to Microsoft power bi. Those are the two dominant visualization tools in the market these days.

So you can choose to become an expert in SQL and decent in one of the visualization tools or you can choose to become an expert in one of the visualization tools in decent and SQL. From there, start doing Job searches, not for the title data analyst, but for the skills SQL and tableau or SQL and Power bi. There are ton of data analyst positions that aren't called Data analysts. I've been called everything from an information delivery analyst to an analytics analyst to a reporting analyst, etc."

You might be able to do analyst / DS-type work for a restaurant or a restaurant chain. I understand if you don't want to work in a restaurant anymore, but that doesn't mean you have to avoid the whole industry where you already have a good understanding.

I might be wrong because again, I never wanted to work as a data scientist (I like to build products using ML or specifically work on NLP products). So take the content of what I say with a grain of salt.

I think there is a very important point for any type of interview - ask yourself what does this team use? You will probably be asked: - About what you said you know. - About what they know. - Some weird test that is generic.

Points 2 and 3 are problematic (you probably already know to solve point 3 via Leetcode, books, and intelligence corps). For point 2, your interviewer might be a complete idiot without an understanding of theory and programming skills, that learned a few anecdotes about linear regression (StatsQuest, he did not read the math) and now is completely sure that if you don't remember some assumptions (they probably like to talk about Homoscedasticity to sound smart) you ""lack of basic knowledge"" (even though he does not know what is the definition of derivative). In this case, if you want to work there you have to learn what they use (SQL, boosting, linear regression, etc.). And yeah, I believe that in the case of this type of person, it will always be something easy such as linear regression or trees (small brains always think they are right, so learn the simple stuff well!).

If the interviewer happens to be smart (or not arrogant?), you can do nothing, just be yourself and don't hide it if you don't know (if it's the arrogant type hide it as much as you can xD). A good sign for a smart person is that she asks questions if she does not understand, and doesn't state ""facts"" too early (e.g. why didn't you use a NN for it???? While the task is extrapolation...), at least in my opinion.

Of course, we are all on a spectrum between this idiot and angel, but there is a clear tendency most of the time and for most of us it's easy to spot. Anyway, good luck!"
1132a1j,j8o2nlr,13,"As far as resources, I recommend the manager tools podcast to anyone that will listen. There are literally years worth of information there.

As for my advice based on being a manager for a while now:

**In data science specifically, being the boss doesn't mean you know more about DS than the people you manage**. In other fields, this isn't true. Like, if you're a manager of an accounting team, you likely more know about accounting that everyone that reports to you. That isn't true in DS. The reason you are managing people isn't your expertise as an individual contributor. The reason you are managing people because someone thinks that you will be good at helping your company get the most out of your team. 

For some managers, that is technical guidance. For some managers, is being a good salesperson that can advocate for projects/individuals. For some managers, that just means being a good sounding board. For most good managers, it's a little bit of everything. 

I think the best advice I can give someone who is becoming a manager for the first time, is to come up with a list of two things:

1. What can your team help you with?
2. What does your team need help with?

And make sure that your time is fairly split between those two. To be clear - normally what you need your team to help you with are the things that the organization needs = value. You need your team to produce things that can impact the company's bottom line. 

What your team needs will vary greatly from team to team and person to person."
1132a1j,j8obwjp,9,"A life lesson for me was joining a project that previously was entirely done by one person - we were supposed to work together to jointly develop the application but in practice it was kind of owned by the original person and I was contributing to it. I’d submit pull requests, but the other person would very often find fault with them, nitpicking over style, re-implementing the features himself etc. While there is a place for maintaining consistency throughout a code base, what I found interesting was how demoralising it was for me to keep working on that project. I ended up kind of disengaging and from a management perspective it was probably a bit of a failure because we didn’t really end up working together. In contrast, the projects that I find most motivating still have code reviews and feedback, but it feels more like I have more latitude to make decisions and have my designs make it into the code. 

So the lesson is, I think it’s better to tolerate some inconsistency or things that aren’t your favourite style, in order to provide more autonomy to others in your team and allow them to feel like they have a stake in what they’re doing. So letting go a little of the notion that something you’re working on will look exactly the way that you envisaged, which is what you’d be used to as a lone wolf"
1132a1j,j8p8u3x,7,Best piece of advice. Ask people what they want to do then assign them those tasks. That usually solves 80% of problems because motivated people are self managing.
1132a1j,j8nowvx,13,"Ok, I don't work in Data Science (yet), but I do have a current role that is very team-oriented and no one has answered your question so I figure I'll attempt to contribute. 

&#x200B;

The hardest part of working with people (in my personal experience) is learning not to take things personally. If Joe is mean mugging you, that isn't your problem if he's otherwise on top of his stuff. If Betsy is always asking clarifying or detailed questions of you, she most likely wants to be sure she knows exactly what she needs to do also. People may be quieter or louder than you think is ""normal"" and won't know that they're not contributing in a positive way unless you tell them, but, don't make it personal. 

&#x200B;

I tend to have a daily check-in with the people I directly supervise and I ASK SPECIFIC QUESTIONS about aspects of their day because if I ask, ""Is there anything you need my help with,"" they will all say ""No, everything is fine.""  They aren't trying to hide things from me but they may not know what I need to know about or they may be afraid I will be unhappy with them. 

&#x200B;

With colleagues that I do not supervise and am not supervised by I have an email vs meeting rule. If it can be communicated in an email, then we don't need a meeting. I have one team member that REALLY WANTS to be in charge and LOVES to call last-minute meetings. I spent about five months trying to refocus her and negotiate when/how we meet before I got fed up and kicked the issue up to our boss. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, this is all a long-winded way of saying that communication needs to be frequent, but not too much, everyone needs a clear role to play and most of the time it isn't personal."
1132a1j,j8ow7ja,5,"Learn to listen. I don’t mean, pay attention and understand, I mean, help build upon the thoughts and ideas your colleagues present. You can do this buy asking questions. Next time you catch yourself saying, “I think….” Change that to a, “do you think…?” This will show your colleagues you’re _willing_ to engage and _encourage_ their ideas.

1132a1j,j8o09un,11,"Stack rank your team, and then force all canddiate team members to pass leetcode questions you can’t solve. You’ll eventually end up with a team comprised of 23 year old socially inept weirdos who prefer not to interact with humans and instead channel their attention to grinding tedious and irrelevant tasks. If their moral drops, who gives a shit? Your stack rank process will cycle them out before they can quit and your employer’s recruiting arm will already be handling such a large volume of backfill headhunting from the stack ranking you won’t notice if a few sneak out on their own accord. 

Meanwhile, you can buffer your position by convincing that crew to not want to ever be management but instead follow the “IC” path which basically just lets them make more money doing the same tedious irrelevant tasks and corners them in a position where they have no bearing over the actual direction of the company. You can trick them into thinking they have agency by letting them consult on system architecture, but ultimately you are the one holding the purse strings and the keys to their desk. 

If those ICs end up making more than you, just hide their stapler for a month somewhere and watch their productivity drop until they’re stack ranked out, or issue a mandatory return to office after they’ve moved to some small quiet town where there are even less people for them to accidentally interact with. 

If recruiting is slow, then cry about shortages of talent and join lobbying efforts of big tech and body shops to get more H1B issued. Classify your staff as clerical data entry and pay them below bans for the actual work they do. If you get tagged for it, then just get those kids to give you connections to offshore body shops and lay off the entire local team except for a single junior who’s still too green to understand how the corporate world works."
