It's been five years since I moved to Toronto and six months since I left my restaurant job to pursue a career in data analysis and study full time(LinkedIn, Kaggle). I have a degree in computer science from Greece in 2010.

Additionally, I have a website on GitHub showcasing my skills with Excel, PowerBI, SQL, and Python (beginner) and added it to my functional resume, since I don't have any work experience in the data field. I am especially proficient with Excel and PowerBI and am aware that I need to continue learning SQL and become more acquainted with window functions and CTEs.

I recently accepted a job offer to work as a bank teller for a big bank so I can get my foot in the door and hopefully in the future to find a role that suits me, ideally around data. Given my current situation, what should my plan be?

• Should I focus all my studying hours on SQL ?

• Should I familiarize myself with the skills the bank is looking for when they're hiring data analysts?

• Would it be beneficial to look into freelance opportunities as well?

Ultimately, I'm willing to work part-time or even for free in order to gain experience in the field. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/11dihvd/seeking_advice_from_restaurant_job_to_data/

I'd appreciate your help if this is the right place to ask. I'm working with a pretty large dataset and this is my first databricks/pyspark experience. Fundamentally, my strategy has been, ""load in this entire table, and then interact with it with pyspark."" I thought that's what pyspark is for.

​

Anyway, so far it's worked. But now i need to run models, and i built a RF that failed. And it wasn't something wrong with that model, because when I tried to kcluster, I got the same error.

I would so deeply appreciate anyone's help as no one I know is familiar with pyspark or databricks. A few people have suggested I spin up an EC2 instance and process the data there, which I will definitely do in the future.

​

What is the best thing to do going forward? I can't imagine pyspark isn't able to handle a task like this - i'd think this is what it's made for! Ideally, I'd like to get this working in pyspark.

​

Alternatively, I suppose I can batch the data. But as a noob, I don't really understand how batching the data into independent tables is beneficial if I still need to store it all in the model. But i don't really know much about data engineering - conceivably I could vectorize every arbitrary grouping I define (user or user session or something), but I don't want to writing code outside of what I understand - my linear algebra and DE are shaky.

dataanalysis,11d6fff,Wondering if this is micromanaging or if this is just something I need to improve and be better at?,Astro-path2716,1677485377.0,Career Advice,2,1.0,"Hey everyone so I’ve been at my job as a data analyst for a little more than 1 year. I got my masters in statistics and wanted to get into the data analyst field since my bachelors so I was really excited when I got my job. Since the last year my boss has been shooting down basically most of my ideas. They gave me survey data to work with and at first I suggested doing some models but I was told that was too advance for public health stakeholders and just should stick to descriptive statistics. Well when we presented to stake holders they ended up asking for more advanced statistics so after that I was allowed to do a manuscript. As I was writing it, I went based of their goals from their survey. I wasn’t part of the development of the survey and was just responsible for finding something interesting based on their goals. But when my boss saw it she just asked me why I did it that way, then I explained to her my rationale for using a logistic regression but then she started questioning why I even chose those questions as part of the goals which i responded as those were the questions defined in their documentation(she was part of the survey development) as part of the goals.  She said I still hadn’t explained why I did it so she  asked me if I had a comprehensive report of all the survey questions which I  didn’t. Because my first task had been to do descriptive statistics.  But now I was now being tasked to do some modeling not to do a bunch of cross tabulations.  I had already written over 40 pages of a manuscript and she basically asked me to start over and so then I asked for clarification if they wanted to do every possible combination of 50 questions or a summary of what I found interesting? I thought I was going base off their goals and wasn’t sure what she wanted from me. Which then I was told to do a comprehensive report of demographics against the 50 survey questions. So I did it in a dashboard and which was the first time this department had even used a dashboard. I was pretty happy and excited to learn how to do a dashboard.  When I presented it to her she praised it but then started having so many edits and changes. I didn’t feel like she was satisfied with my work. Some of her feedback was that she didn’t like that I had used the questions as titles and wanted them now as statements, and she said it was personal preference but yet she continued going through a list of these things I need to change in the graphs. This has been going for 5 months and I can’t move forward with anything in this project . Everytime I try to do what she wants and present it to her she asks me if I have done something else and now I have to do that something else and it just keeps on repeating. I’ve asked her to give me a template of what she wants but she doesn’t have an answer. She just tells me to ask myself what is this telling people. In the comprehensive report/dashboard she asked me to remove questions because she said “you have to ask yourself, does this question have any meaning?” I was told to do a comprehensive report so I didn’t remove any questions and I didn’t write the questions myself she and the team wrote the questions so I’m confused why they wrote questions they don’t think are meaningful to begin with? I guess the team has noticed I’ve been “arguing” with her but all I think I’ve done is ask for clarification so I can have some progress and be able to satisfy their needs. Ever since then she’s been asking me to email her everyday what I’m going to do and when I’m clocking in and when I’m clocking out. This started about 4 months ago. Even on her days off/ vacation she’ll ask me to send her an email CCing her and my other supervisor. I understand CCing my present supervisor but I’m not sure why her as well since she’s on her days off. I’m looking for another job rn and feel so disillusioned in this job. I felt like none of my work was satisfactory and was constantly questioned for what I had done. I started wondering if maybe I’m an idiot and couldn’t understand what they wanted or if they were not being clear. I’ve spoke to another data analyst in the team and she told me she felt the same way. She doesn’t like working with our boss because she constantly interrupts and has also shot down all of her potential publications. My only fear with this is that I know I only have a little over a year of experience and I’m missing something and go to another job not learning how I can be a better data analyst.

Now as for Charlotte Chaze data analytics program, has anyone taken it? Is it a legit program? Did it help you in anyways? Any information would be very helpful.... I found her through google.

Based on my understandings, her program is to simply help you learn the basics of data analytics, help start build a portfolio, and do some projects at the same time. She also said that you will have the program and the discord community on hand forever. These are the few things why I'm interested in her program. Her program is also affordable compared to other programs I have seen. But I know that her program is not meant to be a miracle.

The reason why I don't want to pursue other programs, such as the google course, is because I have heard that it does not really teach you data analytics. Instead, it lectures you on whether or not why you do data analytics. My brother tried this program recently and after 4 months he quit because he thought it was teaching him nothing.

dataanalysis,11blobr,Honest Review of Google Analytics Certificate,Aggravating-Mind-657,1677333630.0,Career Advice,43,0.98,"I am about done with my capstone project in the final course of the Google Analytics Certification Process. I was a Planning and Analysis Manager a decade ago and took the course to get back into being a Data Analyst after a decade in marketing, martial arts, travel, and other projects. I found that my personality and skillset are best suited for working more on my own as an analyst.

I took the course to brush up on my skills and learn new ones. I watched a number of Youtube videos on how great the course is for getting into Data Analytics. Most of those videos have affiliate marketing links and aren't an unbiased take on the course and many of the people making reviews likely didn't take the course.

Here are some of my thoughts and observations.

The course says it takes 240 hours to complete. I think it could be done in 80 to 100 hours while watching all the videos in each course, doing the learning logs, practice problems, and capstone. If you are a college student on break, just bite the bullet and knock it out in 2 to 3 weeks. If you are a full-time professional, put in 10 hours a week and knock it out in 2 months.

If you are new to data analysis, the background, thought process, how to present findings, ideas, and career advice are very helpful. You can get much of the same advice from other online sources as well. If you have experience, you are basically doing the course for the certificate and picking up some new tricks and tips.

The technical aspects on Excel are solid. The Tableau, SQL and R are very basic. Anybody who takes the course as a beginner will need to learn a lot more Tableau, Excel, SQL, R or Python in order to really prepare themselves for a data analyst role. Also, depending on field, AWS, Salesforce, Google Analytics Tags, etc.

I have seen some people on here post their gripes about the course. Its a great start, almost like a Data Analytics 101 class, but then you have to challenge yourself to take the 200, 300 and 400 level classes in Tableau, Python, R, SQL, and Excel to build upon that foundation. Networking and building a portfolio are important as well. As you learn something new in SQL, or tableau take on a new project while the learning is fresh and pop it up on your portfolio.

The certificate and course aren't a silver bullet or magical. Its just the initial foundation that will require a lot more time, energy and work to learn, build a portfolio, networking, and apply for jobs. Its just the start, not even close to the finish.

Also, I looked at the job postings within the Google Data Analytics job site. Most of the jobs aren't entry level and a number of them require Bachelors or Masters in STEM fields. I am not sure they would really consider a non-college grad with just the certificate.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/11blobr/honest_review_of_google_analytics_certificate/

Transitioning out of the military in a bit more than a year and looking to do data analytics when I get out.

So my question for the group: Are there any offline/downloadable courses or training programs that you could recommend for me to do while deployed given my internet situation? Looking for something I can download entirely in advance or do mass downloads when I get internet access every few weeks.

Quick BG info about me: currently working at a high school, I have two bachelor's degrees in biology and psychology. The only relevant experience there is working with SPSS and basic probability stats during university.

How I plan on breaking into the field: I purchased DataCamp courses when they were on sale, I really enjoyed the lesson structure and I figured it's worth paying the $150~ I think it was for it. Currently doing the career track for ""Data Analyst in SQL"", then I plan on doing ""Data Analyst in Tableau"", then ""Data Analyst in Python"". DataCamp offers certifications for these as well so I plan on doing those. I then plan on getting the Google certification and the IBM certification from Coursera. Then I will do 3-5+ personal projects, make a portfolio, write a resume, and start applying.

Once summer comes around I'll be out of work too so I'll have extra time, I was debating on maybe picking up a data entry job too as a stepping stone while I'm completing all my certs. Is that a good idea or should I just focus on completing the certs/projects? Should I add the ""Data Analyst with R"" course to my list as well or is that overkill?

I was just looking for advice on what to expect out of these interviews. I’ve always worked low-skill jobs and am nervous, while eager, about breaching into the professional world.

Dear everyone,

I am pleased to inform you all that I have recently been accepted for a data analyst role. I recently turned 50, and I would like to encourage everyone to keep their hopes high in pursuing any career they desire.

Initially, I was learning to become a web developer, but I just decided to change my plans to focus on developing my skills in data analytics. By combining my efforts in both web development and data analytics, I hope to enhance my expertise and proficiency in the field of data analysis.

To start my journey, I will be taking the Google Data Analytics course, while continuing with the Statistics and Excel courses that I have already begun on Coursera. I am grateful for all the support that I have received from this amazing community and would appreciate any further advice or feedback that you may have for me.

If you would like to follow my progress, you can find me on #onehoursmarter. 

Unfortunately, I am not able to share any details about my new role due to a signed NDA.

Thank you all again for your support.

Graduated with a BS in Bio in May 2020, working as a MT/MLS with a lot of Excel-heavy tools that put me through a crash course of functions, formulas, pivot tables, and putting together reports. Went through the Google Data Analytics Certificate, plus a small amount of independent SQL/Python courses on DataCamp. Offer is at a large BioTech company with a local branch for 70k, 6% match and optional hybrid/fully remote!

A lot of things went into my choice to pursue data analytics. Wanting to spend more time doing my hobbies/looking after my health, spending times with my partner and friends, and something I'm immediately excited for: getting rid of the 30-minute commute combined with a 15-minute walk to and from the parking lot (perks of working at a *very* large hospital). But I also learned I had a knack for playing with numbers! This started with pulling, cleaning, and presenting a lot of lab data; time flew, and I steadily improved how I went about it with advanced Excel shenanigans. I heavily leaned on this during my job search.

Very excited for this opportunity; it is actually a decrease in pay when overtime/on call pay is taken into account, but the 401k match (from 0%), lack of commute, and no longer feeling stagnant in my career more than make up for it. I was very transparent about my minimal experience in programming and they made it clear that training would be offered for Python/R/SQL if I wanted to advance beyond Excel! All in all, it feels like a dream come true position wise for an aspiring analyst.

For example, I want to create a dashboard of KPIs using the Tableau Superstore dataset (similar to [this](https://workout-wednesday.com/2022w31tab/) dashboard), but I want to use SQL to make my calculations before moving over to Tableau. So let's say I want to find the sum of sales, profit, and orders per month per year. I also went ahead and calculated the percent change in sales, profit, and orders (just in case I wanted to use them for something). That query is below:

    -- separate month and year to group orders by month
    With date as (
    Select DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%m') as month, DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y') as year,
    		sales, profit, order_id
    From orders
    ),
    
    -- sum sales and profit
    sums as (
    Select month, year, ROUND(SUM(sales), 2) as sales, ROUND(SUM(profit), 2) as profit, 
    		COUNT(distinct order_id) as sum_orders
    From date
    Group by month, year
    Order by month ASC, year ASC
    )
    
    -- month over month sales, profit, and orders
    Select month, year, sales, 
    		ROUND((sales - LAG(sales) OVER(order by year, month)) / 
    			lag(sales) OVER(order by year, month) * 100, 2) as percent_change_in_sales,
    		profit,
    		ROUND((profit - LAG(profit) OVER(order by year, month)) / 
    			lag(profit) OVER(order by year, month) * 100, 2) as percent_change_in_profit,
    		sum_orders,
            ROUND((sum_orders - LAG(sum_orders) OVER(order by year, month)) / 
    			lag(sum_orders) OVER(order by year, month) * 100, 2) as percent_change_in_orders
    From sums
    Group by month, year
    Order by year, month

But now if I wanted to display a breakdown of the sub-categories sold as shown in the example dashboard, I wouldn't be able to do any of this because including the sub-categories in my query would break everything up by sub_category. Is that just the necessary evil of having to work with Tableau and to be able to get everything out of Tableau? Should I be more ""general"" with my query and allow Tableau to calculate sums and other things?

First and foremost, I’m trying to change my career path completely.
I have a bachelors in Supppy chain management with a concentration in Informatiom Systems.   I really couldn’t care less about logistics or management.  I was young and naive and honestly did not care about the degree (I was pressured into going) even though I learned quite a bit.  I have worked several jobs, and none of them, including the one I’m at now, have anything to do with my degree for the most part.

I recently started learning Python because I found it interesting and wanted to change my career over to something with programming.  I then found out people with similar to degrees to mine transitioned into analytics which sounds GREAT to me after researching jobs and looking at this sub.  

SOO here’s the thing, my job will pay a large portion of my tuition.  At the very least they’ll pay for 50% of my tuition.  I also have a large amount of free time with this job.  So would it be worth it to stay here and get my masters or self-learn and go ahead and be looking for a job switch in a related field?

I'm interested in obtaining the Google Data Analytics Certificate, as I believe it will be a valuable addition to my resume and help me in my job hunt after I finish my studies.

However, I've heard that the career hub that comes with the Google Data Analytics Certificate is only available to US residents. Can anyone confirm if this is true or if I would be eligible to use the career hub even as an international student on an F-1 Visa?

For context, I have five years of experience as a Social Media Manager, a Bachelor of Science in Business from a top 100 university in the US, and a Bachelor in Marketing from a top 10 university in my home country in South America. Additionally, would it be necessary for me to time my completion of the Google Data Analytics Certificate with the completion of my UCLA program and my OPT application in order to benefit from the career hub that comes with the certificate? Lastly, does anyone know if this certificate is available all year long or is it just for a certain period?

For you to have a general idea. The company is a multinational cooperation. Things are going well everywhere but not in this country. They actually need help. At the same time their competitors are doing really good.

They sell services with the devices they sell, such as programming, extended warranty or accidental warranty.
Their main focus is on selling services

● Salesman performance 
● Store KPIs (basket size, accessories attach rate, service attach rate, traffic, closing ratio).

For example, I work as a Firefighter currently. We collect lots of data every year on our incidents from all types through the [NFIRS](https://www.usfa.fema.gov/nfirs/) system, and we do use them to determine where we should build new stations or place new apparatus into service based on call volume. However, other than mainly being used for fiscal policies, the data sits underutilized. 

Recently, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA, they're an OSHA like agency that guides the fire service) [has begun working on a job classification for Fire Data Analyst](https://www.cpse.org/projects/fire-analyst/) for departments to use to hire someone to utilize this collected data for much more. Some examples of what could be determined with the data are: 

&#x200B;

\- Hospital destination or patient outcome from emergency medical incidents. 

\- Staffing needs based upon incident occurrence during the 24 hour shift period.

\- ROI for various apparatus to see which vehicles really are the cheapest / most reliable. 

\- Wage, benefit & COL comparisons with other similar agencies.

\- Changes in demographics for our population over time.

&#x200B;

Some of the above are already being performed by other associated agencies, like our 911 dispatch center, but they're not very technical nor thorough. Similarly, some is being performed by other employees or firefighters who have an assigned role in a different division within the fire department, and have no IT experience or training to know what the data on the reports can show.

I'd like to know if anyone has experience such as this, or knows anything regarding the NFPA job classification or NFIRS system, and can shed some knowledge on the projects they may have worked on or challenges that were faced.

Anyone have any tips? The job is in the domain I come from but will be my first analyst role. 

I know the basics of vlookup and pivot tables and have been learning about power query just to up my knowledge. Anything else I should focus on?

**UPDATE:** (one week later) The test was 30 minutes and included an Excel workbook with 3 sheets. Three tasks. First task was to create a column that indicated if a value in another column was less than or greater than a certain value (IF functions). 

Second task was to get certain columns from two of the sheets onto the third. Easy VLOOKUP stuff and they even specified which column to use as the key. 

Third task was to create a pivot table that included a specific filter and calculation.

All in all very easy. I made a huge mistake and submitted it with half of the sheet filtered out. Was sure that mistake cost me the job and really beat myself up over it. Was shocked when they called me again. Turns out they didn’t even notice and said I did a great job.

As an upcoming applied mathematics graduate (May 2023), I am currently working as a pool service technician with a salary of $40k. Although I find my work manageable, the upcoming summer season brings extended hours of 50-65 per week under the hot sun. I would rather devote that energy to a career-oriented role that offers more opportunities for growth and development.

Recently, a recruiter reached out to me about an Amazon Manager position. I am drawn to this opportunity because it offers a bump in pay and might provide valuable experience on my resume. However, I am hesitant due to concerns about the demanding work hours, potential stress, and work-life balance. Additionally, I am unsure about the relevance of the position to my long-term career goals in data analysis.

Through my research, I have found that the typical salary for this position is in the range of $60-65k. However, my passion for bodybuilding/powerlifting and the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance make me hesitant to pursue a position that could potentially conflict with my personal goals.

I am seeking advice and insights from anyone who has experience working for Amazon or transitioning into a data analysis/science-related field. Furthermore, I am wondering if this Amazon Manager position is as good as it gets for entry-level jobs out of college or if I should focus on exploring other opportunities.

Currently, I am planning to study abroad in Canada and looking for a college to study Data Analytics. After some research, I found some colleges as follows:

Ontario region:

* Georgian College - **Big Data Analytics**
* Durham College - **Data Analytics for Business Decision Making**
* Conestoga College - **Business Analytics**

British Columbia region:

* Langara College - **Data Analytics**
* Douglas College - **Data Analytics**

My goal is to get a 3-year work permit after graduation. After considering, I found that Langara College has a program that suits me better, and the program also lasts for 2 years. However, between the Ontario and British Columbia regions (specifically Toronto and Vancouver), I feel I prefer living near Toronto because there are more job opportunities and a livelier environment here.

Therefore, I would like to ask for your opinion on the review of the colleges and which college I should choose. Or do you have any other recommendations?

In addition, I also want to ask you if I study a 1-year data analytics program, what should I prepare for in the second year (after finishing the program), I heard that schools have some combination courses for a one-year program.

About my background, I am from VN and I graduated from a university majoring in Information Systems, with basic knowledge in related fields. I also have experience working in Vietnam as a Product Owner and Product Operation.

dataanalysis,10zwafm,Faked interview led to a 80k job and suffered ever since - what should I do?,ladynopinion,1676145235.0,Career Advice,67,0.83,"
I’m a 29 F never had any full time job before. With a all-star career coach’s help (he is my partner), I landed an analyst role in a tech company. My teammates are awesome, they are convinced that I’m a multi-functional talent with strong personality and placed me in a project facing role to deal with complex situations.

The reality is I’m beyond incompetent, suck at writing, communication and analysis. This is my first proper job, I even struggled using Excel. My major in college is landscape design and I’m a half decent drawer and painter.

Over the past year, my partner shadowed me for dealing with all the difficult situations, helped me prepare for each presentation and rewrote most of the important emails. I’ve learned a lot but obviously not enough. Something like financial/ analytical mindset is so hard to train. 

Family wise, I have 3 young kids. Meal prep, housework, taking care of kids while doing my current job just seems impossible.

After landing the job, I got vertigo several times, at least once a week I need Tylenol for headache, had one blackout and gained 15 lbs. I had many panic attacks and constantly wake up around 3 am sweating about next day’s work.
I feel ashamed and completely useless, having trouble looking in the mirror.

I see 3 options:

1-Quit my current job and find another analyst job on my own
2-suck it up and learn
3-switch career to art/ design field

Please share your thoughts.

Edit:
Thank you everyone! I didn’t expect this many responses. Apart from sharing my art work, I’ve never posted anything on any social media before. You guys truly helped me organize my thoughts and see possibilities.

I think what stressed me the most is presenting and meetings. My current role only requires SQL, Excel and a little bit of Tableau. I’ve improved quite a bit using tools and will continue to learn, but still very uncomfortable presenting. 
I gave the wrong signal during interviews, mislead them to think I’m the presenter type. Our team has 9 analysts and I’m the one with most exposure to the rest departments in the company. My manager is very supportive, whenever I need to present, she’ll always try to be there in case I can’t handle some questions. I stuttered and felt nauseated many times.

Here’s what I’m going to do:
1- hire help for housework 
2- my year end review conversation is coming next week. I’m going to ask to switch for a role with less exposure, that’ll reduce pressure on me
3- go to the office more often, so my help is out of reach. When WFH, we set a new rule where he will not touch my keyboard 
4- exercise regularly

I started my first Data Analysis role this week. The analytics team is very new and one of the projects they're working in involves collecting data from clients over time to demonstrate ROI.

We've devised a paper based system currently but we have our doubts that the clients will engage well with this. Either filling it in sporadically, not at all or making stuff up to get it filled in. Ideally the client would be able to fill it in 'in the field' (quite literally, they're farmers), or during a monthly in person consultation

A mobile app has been discussed but a) I'm not sure it's necessary and b) that will take a long time to develop.

1) What are some simple data collection systems that can be put together quickly?

I'm okay with Python and eager to learn further, but by no means a developer.

2) What would be the best way to store and display the data?

dataanalysis,10zrsev,Help interpreting t-test results,Economy-Watch4142,1676133647.0,,1,1.0,"Hello! I'm currently doing analysis on a dataset to compare the salaries of men and women. The columns in my dataset are, for example: ""Men Age 18-26"", ""Women Age 18-26"", ""Men - Management"", ""Women Management"", etc. There are about 6 categories total for each men and women. 

Each row in the dataset (around 5k) represents a city; the wages represented  under each column are therefore the average hourly wages earned in that particular city. For example, on average in a certain city, an male manager makes 30$ per hour and a female manager makes 28$ per hour. 

After doing a great deal of visualisation, it's easy to see that men are paid more than women in all categories, except the age 18-26 age bracket. 

I am now looking to do a test to see if the differences I am seeing are indeed significant. I chose to use the t-test, as I compared only 2 categories at a time, ""Male Manager"" VS ""Female Manager"", for example.

**The results are as follows(computed in Python):** 

\-Manual Worker - Male VS Female:  t-statistic: -50.1750 / p-value: 0.0  
\-Employee - Male VS Female:   t-statistic: -70.5252 / p-value: 0.0  
\-Manager - Male  VS Female : t-statistic: -86.197 / p-value: 0.0  
\-Age 26-50 - Male VS Female: t-statistic: -51.441 / p-value: 0.0  
\-Age 50+ -Male VS Female: t-statistic: -63.840 / p-value: 0.0  
\-**Age 18-25 - Male VS Female: t-statistic: -29.435 / p-value: 06.6182**  


I would therefore like to conclude that there is significant difference between Male and Female earnings for each position, with the exception of the age group 18-25 years old. 

I would appreciate any feedback, especially regarding the choice of the test. From my research t-test seemed like the best option. Is this so? Would you recommend a different test? Also, I feel as though I could be missing some information concerning the p-value, is there a way in Python to show more decimal places?

(PS: I realize that this dataset may have some limitations. I do not have education level and numbers of years of experience, for example, to consider.)

I've read a lot of Statistics articles + datacamp courses. but implementing and Learning is better, hence i didn't use any over the top statistics such as ""Showcasing Distribution graph"" and Dealing with outliers. As i didn't want to over complicate it before i get a review on it.

Happy to hear any critics, i want to improve on my skills. Before jumping to SQL and Power Bi, i know the basics but haven't made any ""unguided"" projects yet.

dataanalysis,10wama1,A Wordle Statistical Anomaly,Frequent_Meet_7531,1675797996.0,,3,1.0,"So my wider family has a group chat where we post our daily Wordle “grids”, alongside our score, and at the end of each day a monthly leaderboard is updated.

For those who don’t know, Wordle is a game whereby the player has to guess a random 5 letter word each day, with no clues. You get six attempts and on each line you get told whether each letter in your word is correct (green square), correct but in the wrong position (yellow square), or altogether wrong (grey square). So if the word was SCARE, and your opening word was CHOKE, your “grid” would show 🟨⬜️⬜️⬜️🟩. 

A new player recently joined, and we noticed that she was really good. Like, outrageously good. Immediately, she was top of the monthly leaderboards, and also managed to get 2 words in one guess in a month, which in itself is enormously unlikely, but not necessarily impossible. 

However, what we have noticed is that, alongside her good scoring, she constantly seems to be getting really high quality first words, with several yellows and greens. The fact that she would be beating us is not an indication of cheating in itself - she could just be really clever. However, no matter how good you are, nobody could really be consistently better than anyone else on the first word. It would surely be impossible, as it’s totally random.

So I did a bit of analysis. This person joined 40 days ago, and using a scoring system of 2 points for a green letter, 1 point for a yellow, and 0 for a grey, I did a “quality of first word” analysis for all 15 players, for the full 40 days, and created a ranking.

My hypothesis was that I should be on top or close to it - given that I use the same word every day, and have deliberately chosen my word (RAISE) because it contains 5 of the 6 most common letters (apparently). However, I would have also hypothesised that nobody would really be enormously above or below anyone else with their total “first word score”, because realistically, a random word over 40 days shouldn’t produce an anomaly.

The scores in this analysis ranged from 71 in 15th position, to 94 in second position (indeed myself). The person we are suspicious of scored 157 points, so is a huge outlier. Even removing all data from the days where she got the word in one go, there is still a gap of 47 points to the second placed player. 

My question then is - what sort of analysis could I do to prove that this anomaly is definitely cheating? Anything? Or is the anomaly in itself proof? I would have thought 40 days may not be enough. It’s not much of a big deal, but quite a few of us are feeling like the fun has gone because it feels so obvious!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/10wama1/a_wordle_statistical_anomaly/

I've been a Data Analyst for about 7 years and have switched companies about 3 times now. I became interested in this career field due to both the creative aspects of it and also the potential impact I can leave on a company. However...  

1. \~70% of my time is spent validating/cleaning data, which I'm good at but \*greatly\* dislike. I dislike it because not only is it a very tedious and monotonous process, but the data is never accurate. Usually, I validate the data against another source of truth, and it's just never correct. Or, even worse, the data source becomes inaccurate later down the road and then the client points it out, which makes our reports that we put so much time into untrustworthy. I'm usually not the one wrangling the data - in all three companies, we've had an Engineering team handling that. I'd prefer it this way because I don't like SQL that much. But man, is it frustrating and extremely stressful because it leads to pushing back deadlines or not getting to the creative part, which I enjoy. So far this year, I've had to create 9 tickets due to data errors I've spotted...  
2. I barely see the impact. I may hear things from my manager here and there (oh, so and so client really loved the report you put together!) but I never hear how my reports help them make key business decisions.

datascience,11dr9hx,MSc Biology in Biomedical Data Science to CS/DS/ML industry?,itsmarq,1677542804.0,Education,2,1.0,"TL;DR: offered a fully-funded Master’s position with a CS/ML faculty prof, with a project in my area of interest (AI/ML in biomedical science). However, as a biomed major, I’d have to be doing the masters as an MSc in Biology, rather than MSc in CS. How transferable is this to industry, provided I’m okay with another 1-year MSc in (bio)statistics/data science if needed? Alternate plan is to do an accelerated BSc in CS.

Hey everyone. I finished my Bachelor’s in Biomedical Science in Canada, and for a year after graduation, had worked in wet lab research. [After taking the time to explore my careers and interests](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/108lp08/computer_science_biostatistics_health_informatics/), I was planning on doing an accelerated bachelor’s in CS + a master's in biostatistics. Through this, my goal was to do research using data science within a biomedical/clinical context, while also having robust credentials for industry if things go awry.

However, I recently got offered a fully-funded Master’s position by one of my professors. They are primarily appointed in the CS department, with research in ML for drug discovery, cancer biology, etc. The project aligns very well with my interests, however, as my current credentials are in biomedical science (not CS), he is only able to offer the position through a Master's in Biology, as opposed to a Master's in CS.

That being said:

* How transferrable would this MSc in Biology be towards the general CS/DS/ML industry? 
* Overall, provided my interests, would this be a wise decision career-wise?

I’m also fine with doing another internship-based MSc in (bio)statistics or data science after this program, if need be (e.g. if the MSc in Bio isn’t recognized). I would have enrolled in those directly if it weren’t for missing prerequisite courses (which I plan on taking in the BSc in CS or MSc in Bio).",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/11dr9hx/msc_biology_in_biomedical_data_science_to_csdsml/

datascience,11d6gml,Wondering if this is micromanaging or if this is just something I need to improve and be better at?,Astro-path2716,1677485497.0,Discussion,3,0.67,"Hey everyone so I’ve been at my job as a data analyst for a little more than 1 year. I got my masters in statistics and wanted to get into the data analyst field since my bachelors so I was really excited when I got my job. Since the last year my boss has been shooting down basically most of my ideas. 

They gave me complex survey design data to work with and at first I suggested doing some models but I was told that was too advance for public health stakeholders and just should stick to descriptive statistics. Well when we presented to stake holders they ended up asking for more advanced statistics so after that I was allowed to do a manuscript. 

As I was writing it, I went based of their goals from their survey. I wasn’t part of the development of the survey and was just responsible for finding something interesting based on their goals. But when my boss saw it she just asked me why I did it that way, then I explained to her my rationale for using a logistic regression but then she started questioning why I even chose those questions as part of the goals which i responded as those were the questions defined in their documentation(she was part of the survey development) as part of the goals.  She said I still hadn’t explained why I did it so she  asked me if I had a comprehensive report of all the survey questions which I  didn’t. Because my first task had been to do descriptive statistics.  But now I was now being tasked to do some modeling not to do a bunch of cross tabulations.  I had already written over 40 pages of a manuscript and she basically asked me to start over and so then I asked for clarification if they wanted to do every possible combination of 50 questions or a summary of what I found interesting? I thought I was going base off their goals and wasn’t sure what she wanted from me. Which then I was told to do a comprehensive report of demographics against the 50 survey questions. 

So I did it in a dashboard and which was the first time this department had even used a dashboard. I was pretty happy and excited to learn how to do a dashboard.  When I presented it to her she praised it but then started having so many edits and changes. I didn’t feel like she was satisfied with my work. Some of her feedback was that she didn’t like that I had used the questions as titles and wanted them now as statements, and she said it was personal preference but yet she continued going through a list of these things I need to change in the graphs. This has been going for 5 months and I can’t move forward with anything in this project . 

Everytime I try to do what she wants and present it to her she asks me if I have done something else and now I have to do that something else and it just keeps on repeating. I’ve asked her to give me a template of what she wants but she doesn’t have an answer. She just tells me to ask myself what is this telling people. In the comprehensive report/dashboard she asked me to remove questions because she said “you have to ask yourself, does this question have any meaning?” I was told to do a comprehensive report so I didn’t remove any questions and I didn’t write the questions myself she and the team wrote the questions so I’m confused why they wrote questions they don’t think are meaningful to begin with? 

I guess the team has noticed I’ve been “arguing” with her but all I think I’ve done is ask for clarification so I can have some progress and be able to satisfy their needs. Ever since then she’s been asking me to email her everyday what I’m going to do and when I’m clocking in and when I’m clocking out. This started about 4 months ago. Even on her days off/ vacation she’ll ask me to send her an email CCing her and my other supervisor. I understand CCing my present supervisor but I’m not sure why her as well since she’s on her days off. 

I’m looking for another job rn and feel so disillusioned in this job. I felt like none of my work was satisfactory and was constantly questioned for what I had done. I started wondering if maybe I’m an idiot and couldn’t understand what they wanted or if they were not being clear. I’ve spoke to another data analyst in the team and she told me she felt the same way. She doesn’t like working with our boss because she constantly interrupts and has also shot down all of her potential publications. My only fear with this is that I know I only have a little over a year of experience and I’m missing something and go to another job not learning how I can be a better data analyst.

datascience,11ddrkr,DataOps Best Practices for Maintaining HIPAA Compliance in Healthcare,ismiletechnologies,1677509735.0,Discussion,0,0.25,"As healthcare organizations increasingly rely on data to drive clinical and operational decisions, it’s crucial to ensure that the data is protected and in compliance with regulatory requirements. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) sets the standard for protecting sensitive patient data in the United States, and failure to comply with HIPAA regulations can result in hefty fines and damage to the organization’s reputation. In this blog post, we’ll explore some best practices for implementing DataOps in a healthcare organization to ensure HIPAA compliance.

## Understanding HIPAA Requirements  

The first step in implementing DataOps best practices for HIPAA compliance is to understand the regulations and requirements. HIPAA covers a broad range of topics, from patient privacy to data security to breach notification, so it’s important to have a comprehensive understanding of what the law requires. 

## Identifying Risks and Vulnerabilities  

Once you understand the requirements, the next step is to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities in your data management processes. This could include anything from data breaches to unauthorized access to patient information. 

## Implementing Data Governance  

Data governance is the process of managing the availability, usability, integrity, and security of the data used in an organization. Implementing a comprehensive data governance strategy is essential for maintaining HIPAA compliance and ensuring that data is accurate, complete, and secure. 

## Building a DataOps Team / Managed Services 

DataOps is a methodology that combines data engineering, data integration, and data analytics to streamline data operations and improve data quality. Building a dedicated DataOps team can help ensure that data is managed in a way that complies with HIPAA regulations. ISmile Technologies can help healthcare organizations implement DataOps best practices to improve their data management processes and maintain HIPAA compliance, With a comprehensive data governance strategy, a dedicated DataOps team.

## Using Automated Testing and Deployment  

Automated testing and deployment are key components of the DataOps methodology. By automating these processes, you can reduce the risk of errors and ensure that changes to data management processes are made in a consistent and repeatable way. 

## Conducting Regular Audits and Assessments  

Regular audits and assessments can help identify potential issues before they become problems. Conducting these assessments on a regular basis can help ensure that your data management processes remain in compliance with HIPAA regulations. 

## Training and Education  

Finally, it’s important to provide ongoing training and education to your DataOps team and other employees who handle sensitive patient data. This can help ensure that everyone is aware of the risks and requirements associated with HIPAA compliance and is equipped to handle data in a way that meets those requirements.

datascience,11d03gg,How to allocate time (as a PO of DS & DE teams) for passion projects that my team members wish to pursue that also drive business objectives?,antassantas,1677464358.0,Discussion,4,0.75,"Hello All,

I am a product owner of DS & DE at a <200 startup (going on 4 months now) and have had great success in pushing an agile-lite (not 100% strict) process into place that has received positive feedback from my DS & DE team members.

The problem I am looking to solve now is some DS team members have approached me wishing to pursue passion projects that are not product-driven, but have a good deal of future value to them for the company.

I wanted to ask how yall think I should handle these requests. My current idea would be on allowing those who wish to pursue such projects do so on a time-constraint basis (such as 5-10hr per week) as long as they are getting other work done on time. I don't want to push a bad work-life balance, so I would like to put the impetus on them with the amount they feel comfortable with pursuing, but make sure it doesn't go overboard by providing a check when it feels necessary.

Any suggestions?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/11d03gg/how_to_allocate_time_as_a_po_of_ds_de_teams_for/

Help me to find my way,ADotInTheTimeline,1677453448.0,Career,6,0.8,"I am 22 years old and I am attending an evening computer science high school made for adults who dropped out in their teens. In two and a half years I will finish it and then go to University (not sure if computer science, statistics or something else).

For now in school we are studying computer architecture, ASM(on emu8086) and C programming. These are not things inherent to possible jobs I would like to do but they are giving me a very good foundation on which to build. At home I delve a lot into programming again with C and I am studying in depth mathematics and then starting a course on the mathematics needed for the study of artificial intelligence.

I'm currently working a part-time job that has nothing to do with what I study, it's just to have a minimum of independence while I go on with my studies.

I inquired about possible avenues to pursue but found a lot of confusion. So I really like both theory, math and then subjects more related to data science etc. Both the application and engineering of things. I would like to take the best things from data science and merge them with the best things from software engineering.... Because I know that in both of these professions sometimes the inherent job ads put this label on it but then what you go and do are basic, boring things...

I am a fan of artificial intelligence, for now I use the products of it but I want to get to the point where I know how they were built.

At first I considered data analyst and then scaled up in position and backend developer.

The former I discarded because even though it could lead me to data scientist it would lack the engineering part while the latter I discarded because most of the jobs make it explicit that I will only go to CRUD most of the time...

What job positions exist that taking the best of both worlds and are very much related to artificial intelligence and that you need to have very good theoretical knowledge and great engineering skills ?

datascience,11czf1z,Looking for Direction,TouchToLose,1677462434.0,Projects,0,0.5,"Hello, feel free to delete if not appropriate.  

I am looking for direction on a project.  I am working to create a budgeting tool. I am proficient in Excel, and am comfortable with VBA and Python.  Fully self taught.  The team I am working with are Excel beginners to intermediates.  None of them are familiar with Power Query.

The team works with budgets that vary based on timelines, number of employees, inflation, and other factors such as number of miles traveled.

The current tool is in Excel, and uses fairly extensive and heavy formulas across several sheets.  The person that built the previous tool did their best, but the workbook is a mess, so they want me to make a new tool.

The team uses to tool to pull a budget, make updates to some of the specifications, such as length of time of the project, number of employees, etc.  the tool then outputs a budget with updated values based on the changes.  The next time there needs to be an update to the budget, a team member pulls the most recent budget, and starts the process over again. 

I have previously built similar tools in the same industry at a different company.  I used Power Query to transform the data,  and macros/VBA to format the output.  But eventually the whole got very heavy and would take up to 20-30 minutes to run.  While this was far less time than it would take to do manually, it was not ideal.  And it made it clear that the limits of Excel were being pushed.

The team is pretty set on this being based on Excel, but could possibly be persuaded otherwise if the solution is user friendly.  They have no knowledge of Python or anything like that.  My initial thought was to store the data in a database, and pull budgets into Excel using SQL, allow users to input changes to project specifications, then push back to the SQL server, and do transformations based on users updated specs there.  I have little to no knowledge about SQL.  I am confident I could learn it well enough to implement a solution if this is the best use for this case.

Note that the brands we can recommend are brands that the customer has not yet bought from. 

Essentially I have 4 columns  \[customer\_id, brand\_id, amount, date\] that represent single transactions made per client in a brand. The volume of data is huge (33 million rows) so there is no data scarcity and these transactions are in a 6 month window.

Here's what we plan on doing:

1. First 4 months for training and last 2 months for testing
2. Encode labels (in the training set) for pairs (customer, brand) so that it's 1 if the customer has spent over a certain threshold and 0 otherwise - we ignore brands the customer has not bought from. This threshold would be a different median for each client so that we have the same number of 0's and 1's. In practice the thresholds/medians we obtain are around 20 dollars so the 0's and 1's could be interpreted as the client not liking or liking a brand, respectively.
3. Train a collaborative filtering model (like the SVD) on the train data.
4. Make predictions for the test set and use the Mean Average Precision metric as evaluation metric.

So was an owner of trucking business and 100% of my time was in home office dealing with customers, drivers, accounting and didn’t like the job at all, so when i had an opportunity i sold an moved on.
Then i became an HVAC (heating ventilation air conditioning technician). I enjoy this a lot as most of the time i work individualy on repairs or smaller projects. However, this role i very seasonal and “on call”. A lot of emergencies so you never know when you are going to finish your day (does not help when you have family) Also i like moving around all day but it is physical and years goes by i can tell it is getting tough on the body.

So im slowly looking to possibly change my career where im more flexible and can do the job from office or home within business hours instead of being called to hear i need you NOW. 

I am not religious because i don’t feel like there is any proof. I like to double check facts and confirm them. I always ask why to anything 💁‍♂️. 
I have degree in BSc Exercise, nutrition & Health which is not very relevant. However i remember having classes of “Research Skills” that involved Excel formulas, charts etc that i enjoyed a lot.

My question is if there is anybody in Eastern Europe hired as one and what salary range companies are able to offer there?

Thinking of switching to data analytics for different reasons, the main ones being that I am great at extracting insights from information, I like data in general and my long term goal is to work freelance.

I have been thinking lately about how I could frame my career and how i could sell myself as a data analyst without degrees and a strong background in the field. I came up with the idea of marketing myself as a data analyst capable of covering 3 different fields: 

\- Data analysis: I am self learning SQL, Python. Planning to learn Tableau and/or Power BI. Decent with Excel.

\- Data visualization: I am self taught graphic designer (Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma), web dev (HTML, CSS, limited JS) and I could self learn other softwares to get more advanced with charts/business tools.

\- Data storytelling: I believe my social science Master gives me a key strength in the fact I am able to write nicely, I am good at structuring my thoughts and I have an ability to convey messages/findings to stakeholders. I have been writing essays and articles my whole life. 

I would be self teaching for 5 or 6 months and then I am hopeful to find an entry level position. Do you think this would be realistic and how attractive this profile could be?

Also we have a lot of top-down interference: constantly redefining metrics to say we've hit ridiculous OKRs, extrapolating revenue increases from increases in unrelated metrics, changing our product roadmap that was drafted after being informed by data to cater to exec personal preferences, etc. We also use ML for the sake of it; it's a shiny object to brag about in meetings even though our models are expensive and generally wouldn't beat a basic set of heuristics.

Within my company, shifting to management requires demonstration of leadership, vision and driving strategy. What this exactly translates to is sitting in a lot of meetings, delivering presentations on where to take the data and how to maximize its potential, and then building capital planning documents for budget approval.

The work I shared above is tremendously people intensive, and it takes away a lot of time from doing Data Science ground work. And the risk is once I take this path, my core Data Science skills shrink tremendously. I understand how to solve a problem and can provide guidance, but I lose the details of the process. The past two years I've been yo-yoing between IC and Management, and it's been very difficult to know whether taking the management path is worth the sacrifice of losing technical expertise, or if I should resume in IC.

Within my company, high level ICs hit a plateau in terms of leveling (our department maxes out at Staff), and then one can rest and vest. They do incredible work and partake only complex projects, but the visibility they receive is minimal: they're basically VPs on-call Data Scientists when they need the most expert candidate to answer a problem, but those instances are rare for strategic decisions where you can receive directional information using simple models.

Luckily in my org the managers are incredible managers, and each of them carry a unique trait and are one of the best in terms of unblocking problems and protecting the team from politics. But because of those activities, they're basically full-time people managers. While they help prioritize tasks and provide advice, they do very little of Data Science itself despite their incredible qualification. And all, if not most, admit that all the skill they have left now is SQL and basic python coding to vet and understand their direct report's work. Nothing beyond that as they rely on their team to communicate their approach well.

If you have been at this crossroad between IC and Management, what helped you decide which path to take? And was the sacrifice of losing technical skills or losing visibility worth it in the long run?

EDIT: Just to note, pursuing management and shifting back to IC or vice versa is a very rocky road (annual performance gets delayed as they have to re-adjust their development metric, a lot of paper work, and a quarter or two quarters of re-org to help move direct reports/fill in M or IC role)",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/11aybrw/what_factors_do_you_consider_when_deciding/

datascience,11a96tj,What’s the most straightforward yet accurate way to run multivariate analysis?,busy_bee_movie,1677187443.0,Projects,1,0.57,"My manager asked me to “run multivariate analysis on all of our customers to identify what factors make them churn.” The dataset I extracted has 700,000 rows and 100 variables (~15 are numeric, ~15 are Y/N), the target variable is Boolean (Active/Not Active).

I feel like a fool asking this, but:

1) What would be the most straightforward way to generate some kind of a graphical representation of how these variables affect churn? 
Right now, my setup is: a) remove outliers, drop redundant columns, drop NAs or replace them where applicable, b) hot encode Y/N variables and then check for collinearity by populating a correlation matrix with all numerical variables and dropping anything that stands out, c) dummify categorical variables, d) run decision tree and random forest. Any recommendations/feedback? My manager loves decision tree because it’s easy to interpret and hates logistic regression because “black box algorithms cannot be interpreted.” 

2) I have a couple of limitations, the main one being is that I’m not allowed to drop ANY records from the dataset (“they are our customers and we cannot exclude them.”) I can potentially renegotiate this part especially since I already wrote ~200 lines to make this data look tidy. What would be the best argument to make or is my manager right? At the very least, there are records with insane values (120 years of age, >100 years of being the customer etc.), so I feel like it’s best to get rid of them.

Thank you in advance! The company computer I have is quite old (8GB Ram) and slow, so unfortunately I cannot experiment with a lot of different methods since I have to present the results to the stakeholders at the marketing department on Monday. 

There’s no one at my company that knows R so any little tip is appreciated :)

datascience,118vld0,"I had a conversation with a data science hiring manager at a very large firm, and he told me that the DS world is changing rapidly. Here's why.",WhoIsTheUnPerson,1677064582.0,Career,67,0.85,"A friend of a friend of mine was at a dinner party a few nights ago and we were talking shop, and he told me that he's a hiring manager at a very large technical consultancy, and that the world of data science is changing rapidly, and often not for the better (for those looking to get hired).

**His take:** the last several years has seen an enormous number of SWEs and other experienced programmers transition into data science by taking online courses, brushing up on their statistics, and then nailing their interviews because they have work experience. 

All the best companies scooped up all the best candidates (of course), but what remained was still a huge dearth in qualified data scientists, machine learning engineers, and experienced analysts. But we had tons of programmers who took some certification courses online, maybe enrolled in a few university courses, or even went back to school part-time. Since they had prior experience and strong programming knowledge, they were able to get hired at many non-top-tier firms because the need was so great.

**However:** What is happening now is that tons of higher-level managers are realizing that many of those in data roles actually lack strong statistical and engineering backgrounds, and are surviving based on their programming skills alone. This is making the hiring atmosphere for pure DS/ML roles significantly tougher because there are very few people in the companies that can adequately assess graduate or Ph.D-level statistics knowledge in potential hires, so the hiring process for these roles is slow and expensive.

As such, these companies are transitioning to paying more for fewer truly top-tier data scientists to run their ""data factories"" where they hire far more analysts and programmers with less stats knowledge (for lesser pay), but are still able to take direction from the top and build what they're told to.

Therefore, he's expecting that the role of data analyst will continue to grow (while the salaries shrink) as the bar gets lower and operations get more automated, overseen by the data scientists with deep statistical knowledge.

**The upshot:** He's seeing the world of data engineering *explode* in terms of demand and pay. Those who can collect, organize, and pipeline the data to these ""analysis factories"" are going to be in heavy demand for years to come. It's not nearly as sexy as ML engineering or ""hard data science"" but as demand for data infrastructure grows, so too will the need for those to help manage it. He said that with a few certs an analyst or cloud engineer could easily start the transition and get a lot more job security, particularly if you specialize in data and cloud security.

But if you're looking to get into pure ML engineering, the future isn't looking so bright unless you're truly exceptional at statistics. Too many people calling themselves ""data scientists"" after taking a few online courses seems to have ruined the appetite for these individuals.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/118vld0/i_had_a_conversation_with_a_data_science_hiring/

Then you learn thats outdated and that people use Bert models. But now even that in competition with transformer-based models as ChatGPT is based on etc.

Same thing with time series. First you like ARIMA, then you learn RNN, then LSTM, then Autoencoders, then to use autoencoders as unsupervised feature extraction into a supervised model etc.

datascience,11970ig,What do you think is the best software/language to work on Data cleaning or engineering,Ancient_Reply4583,1677090131.0,Tooling,1,0.57,"I don't know what to call this process. Here's the breakdown of my question: 

- I've realized most of my work requires me to work with absolutely messy datasets. I'm talking column names that don't make any sense, typos, dates that are in varying formats like ""Sat April 3rd"" or ""2019-04-03"", columns broken down into three other columns when they can just be one, etc. 

My work means I have to find these datasets and work with them. But about 70-80 per cent of my time is spent on just cleaning the data to have it look exactly how I want it to look. 

For example, those date columns with values like ""Sat April 3rd"", I will have to break into two columns one for day and one for the date. Then lots of pivot tables, group by's with functions that feed into a dictionary of aggregate functions because I have many columns that work completely differently, etc. 

I usually do all of this using Python. It's not easy, but it gets the job done for the most part. Some parts of this task/process is easier in Excel: replacing nonsensical values with average (I do ctrl + shift + L, select everything but the nonsense, then find the average of the useful information, unselect, then do a replace all for the nonsense). 

I find this a tad bit tedious. Especially if the dataset is too large (say 2000 columns, a couple hundred thousand rows) Excel gets laggy, I have to do the same thing for 2000 columns, etc. Even python sometimes fails to do what I need it to do. 

Say for example I have a dataset that has 30 columns for days of a month. I want those column names (Apr 1st, Apr 2nd, ...) to go into just one column as values of ""date"" and aggregate the information by those days somehow. 

To do this in python, I have to take so many steps to get there. Like, making the transpose of the df using joins and grouobys and merges. 

Since a lot of my work is this, is there a software or tool that does the best job at things like this? I'm comfortable with SQL as I used it during an internship 4 years ago. I just need to refresh my mind. I don't like R, but will learn if I need to. I'm most comfortable with Python. Excel, I know enough to get by but I think it's easy enough to learn. 

I'm not familiar with any other tools. I appreciate any help. I feel like I'm doing way too much to get the result that I want when the task isn't that difficult imo. I just want a more straightforward way to handle these things. If SQL does this better, then I'll get started on that. If it's python, then I'd appreciate some resources on this. Also, what exactly is this process? Is it just pre-processing and data cleaning? Am I right in calling it data engineering? Because, I usually do end up having various versions of the same CSV file for different tasks. I feel like I get a mess of data and give back tabular pretty dataframes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/11970ig/what_do_you_think_is_the_best_softwarelanguage_to/

I know for a fact that they do not utilize data science and/or data pipeline automation to drive business decisions because I have worked for these companies in a business intelligence capacity.

I also know that these businesses don't want to hire a full-time data scientist because of the cost.

As an example of how behind-the-curve some of these companies are, some still use written time sheets for employee time keeping. One of the companies I worked for 2 years ago ($1.5 billion in revenue) was still using Excel workbooks as its ""database"" and using VB to edit the data which had a full team (5+ members) working on the VB code daily.

I personally have 7+ years of analytics and data science experience with small local companies up to  fortune 50 companies as well as a bachelors in math and a masters in Statistics so I am no stranger to data science and it's applications to business. I also have college-level teaching experience from being a TA in my Masters program.

There is no other consulting/services company around within 50 miles for data analytics/business intelligence.

Therefore, I was wondering if anyone had any opinions as to whether or not this sounds like a good area of opportunity for a consulting firm/freelancer in the data science/business intelligence space.

It is a bit frustrating because the outline of the tables are exactly the same, I believe, at least it is the same on all even pages and the same on all uneven pages ; so I am guessing that there should be a way to automate and extract exactly the data for each column or row.

Getting started with DataOps can be a daunting task, but there are several steps insurance CTOs can take to get started. These may include conducting a data maturity assessment, defining a clear data strategy, and building a proof of concept to demonstrate the value of the approach.

#### Measuring the Success of a DataOps Strategy

One of the key benefits of DataOps is its ability to deliver measurable business outcomes. Insurance CTOs should establish clear metrics for success and regularly measure progress against those metrics. This may include measuring data quality, pipeline efficiency, or time to market for new data initiatives.

#### The Role of DataOps in Improving Customer Experience

Insurance CTOs must be able to provide seamless and personalized customer experiences to remain competitive in today’s market. A DataOps approach can help insurance companies better understand their customers by analyzing data from multiple sources, providing insights to improve customer engagement and drive loyalty.

datascience,117otej,Python Pandas: Best way to organize DataFrames with Series that vary in dimensionality?,huapua9000,1676937655.0,Projects,0,0.5,"Hi All,

I have been using Pandas for my data and it’s been great, up to a point, and I was wondering if anyone dealt with the following stumbling blocks and perhaps had any advice:

I am collecting and analyzing data on a material. I have several serial numbers, each unique serial number corresponds to a unique sample of this material.  The serial number serves as the key, i.e, is set as an index in my dataframe. 

This has worked beautifully until I tried to organize, by serial number, data that requires multiple rows. For example, one datapoint like the mass of the sample only needs one row to express, and so it corresponds nicely with the index.  But what can I do when a dataset needs multiple rows, like for example the transmission of light at various wavelengths?  In my mind, the way to do this was to place this series dataset within a list [df[‘Transmission]], effectively nesting that Series into a single row. This seems to work nicely, until I save and load the dataframe (as csv), at which point the formatting gets all messed up and I can’t easily pull the nested dataset out for plotting, or any other operations, because the nested dataset now has a nested index and pandas inserts a line break (/n) between every datapoint after loading.

Anyone have any good ideas on how to organize such a dataset nicely, so that it corresponds to the serial number index, but can still be used for one dimensional and n dimensional datasets at the same time?  My spectral data also needs to be compatible with .loc and filters so that I can conveniently plot subsets of the spectrum based on wavelength filters.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/117otej/python_pandas_best_way_to_organize_dataframes/

I have recently been offered a data scientist position at my current company, but I was told that I would be working exclusively on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and that it won't be necessary to code in Python. I've spent the past year learning about data science, models, and programming, and I'm concerned that all of that knowledge won't be put to use in this new role. I always thought that a data scientist would be in front of their Jupyter notebook, so I'm worried that this is a cheap data scientist position.

My main question is: is it standard for data scientists to work solely on cloud computing platforms like GCP, and is it common to not code in Python? I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences on this.

datascience,1178pyh,DataOps Usecases for Insurance Industry,ismiletechnologies,1676905264.0,Discussion,0,0.5,"In the ever-evolving world of insurance, data is the key to success. The insurance industry relies heavily on data to make informed decisions about risk assessment, pricing, and customer engagement. With the advent of data-driven technologies, the insurance industry is increasingly adopting DataOps practices to optimize their data-driven processes and improve decision making.

DataOps refers to the set of practices and technologies that organizations use to manage their data operations in a more efficient and effective manner. It involves a combination of people, processes, and tools that enable organizations to collect, process, and analyze data in real-time.

In this blog, we will explore some of the most impactful DataOps use cases in the insurance industry and how they can help organizations optimize their operations.

#### Claims Prediction:

One of the most significant applications of DataOps in the insurance industry is the prediction of claims. By leveraging data from various sources such as historical claims data, demographic data, and weather data, organizations can develop predictive models that can help them identify high-risk areas and predict the likelihood of claims in a specific area. This information can then be used to adjust the pricing of insurance policies and to optimize the allocation of resources for claims management.

#### Lifetime Value Prediction:

DataOps can also be used to predict the lifetime value of a customer. This is an important metric for insurance companies as it helps them to determine the cost of acquiring new customers and the expected return on investment. By analyzing customer data such as demographic information, purchase history, and engagement levels, insurance companies can develop predictive models that can help them to estimate the lifetime value of a customer.

#### Influencing Customer Behaviour:

DataOps can also be used to influence customer behavior. By analyzing customer data, insurance companies can identify patterns in customer behavior that can help them to optimize their engagement strategies. For example, by understanding which channels are most effective for reaching a specific customer segment, insurance companies can target their marketing campaigns more effectively and drive customer engagement.

#### Personalizing Marketing Strategies And Targeting Specific Customer Groups:

DataOps can also be used to personalize marketing strategies and target specific customer groups. By analyzing customer data, insurance companies can segment their customers based on various demographic, behavioral, and psychographic characteristics. This information can then be used to tailor marketing campaigns to specific customer segments, resulting in more effective engagement and higher conversion rates.

#### Detecting And Mitigating Risk In Real-Time:

DataOps can also be used to detect and mitigate risk in real-time. By analyzing real-time data from various sources such as social media, news outlets, and weather data, insurance companies can identify emerging risks and take proactive measures to mitigate their impact. This can help organizations to respond quickly to changing conditions and minimize the impact of potential risks on their operations.

#### Detection Of Fraudulent Claims:

Finally, DataOps can be used to detect fraudulent claims. By analyzing claims data in real-time, insurance companies can identify anomalies and potential fraud. This information can then be used to investigate claims and prevent fraudulent activity from occurring.

#### Conclusion:

In conclusion, DataOps has the potential to transform the insurance industry by enabling organizations to make more informed decisions, optimize their operations, and improve customer engagement. By leveraging data from various sources, insurance companies can gain a competitive advantage and drive growth in a rapidly changing market. Whether you are an established insurance company or a start-up, DataOps can help you to achieve your goals and stay ahead of the curve.

ISmile Technologies DataOps Managed Services enable organizations to collect, process, and analyze data in real-time, allowing them to make informed decisions about risk assessment, pricing, customer engagement, and more. With our expertise and cutting-edge technologies, insurance companies can optimize their data-driven processes, increase efficiency, and stay ahead of the competition.

datascience,1162ssq,Buzz around new Deep Learning Models and Incorrect Usage of them.,brokened00,1676785417.0,Discussion,186,0.94," In my job as a data scientist, I use deep learning models regularly to classify a lot of textual data (mostly transformer models like BERT finetuned for the needs of the company). Sentiment analysis and topic classification are the two most common natural language processing tasks that I perform, or rather, that is performed downstream in a pipeline that I am building for a company. 

The other day someone high up (with no technical knowledge) was telling me, during a meeting, that we should be harnessing the power of ChatGPT to perform sentiment analysis and do other various data analysis tasks, noting that it should be a particularly powerful tool to analyze large volumes of data coming in (both in sentiment analysis and in querying and summarizing data tables). I mentioned that the tools we are currently using are more specialized for our analysis needs than this chat bot. They pushed back, insisting that ChatGPT is the way to go for data analysis and that I'm not doing my due diligence. I feel that AI becoming a topic of mainstream interest is emboldening people to speak confidently on it when they have no education or experience in the field. 

After just a few minutes playing around with ChatGPT, I was able to get it to give me a wrong answer to a VERY EASY question (see below for the transcript). It spoke so confidently in it's answer, even going as far as to provide a formula, which it basically abandoned in practice. Then, when I pointed out it's mistake, it corrected the answer to another wrong one. 

The point of this long post was to point out that AI tool have their uses, but they should not be given the benefit of the doubt in every scenario, simply due to hype. If a model is to be used for a specific task, it should be rigorously tested and benchmarked before replacing more thoroughly proven methods.

ChatGPT is a really promising chat bot and it can definitely seem knowledgeable about a wide range of topics, since it was trained on basically the entire internet, but I wouldn't trust it to do something that  a simple pandas query could accomplish. Nor would I use it to perform sentiment analysis when there are a million other transformer models that were specifically trained to predict sentiment labels and were rigorously evaluated on industry standard benchmarks (like GLUE).

I have a situation that I’d very much love your opinion on!

A little bit about myself: 
I have a MS in biomedical engineering, and I’m currently pursuing a MS in analytics. I’m expected to finish the degree by the end of 2023.

I have just over 2 years of experience in a hospital as a research associate. 50% of my job duty is experimental design (mostly A/B testing), analyzing experimental dataset, visualization, etc. The size of the data is usually very small (n=200 or less). And the other 50% is sensors integration and hands on clinical experimental work. I’m also an adjunct professor in university teaching biomedical engineering classes.

I have a couple abstracts in ML published, and one manuscript currently in the work. However,  the journals I submitted to are very health-oriented. The technical findings are not ground breaking, just applying known ML techniques to the experimental data.

Initially I was planning to pursue a PhD in biomed after finishing the analytics MS program, but I find myself swaying away. I’d like to change to a pure DSA career afterwards.

My question is, should I apply to intern jobs and start over, or is my experience in the hospital valid? My work is 100% Python based, I know a bit of SQL from course project and leetcode.

It feels like aiming for a mid level job (2year +) may be too far fetched since I technically only have one full year of experience in DS.

So that may leave me with a new grad/ intern option

datascience,1160iaf,Should I jump ship after just 2 months?,strawberrymonster2,1676777717.0,Career,34,0.85,"I just started my first job at an asset management firm after my Masters' 2 months ago. Recently been contacted by the team lead in a large tech company. He is interested in my past research work (I published two papers out of my masters') and wants to have me in his new team. I am unsure if taking this offer is the right move.

&#x200B;

My current role: Data scientist at a small (\~10 ppl) asset management firm. They are setting up a new quant trading (stat arb) strategy and hired me as part of a new team. I took this offer because I am interested in a quant researcher role but couldn't get in one of those big quant trading firms, so I am trying to use this position as a stepping stone to better places. The problems are:

* The actual job is nothing like what I was told during interview. 75% of the job are ad-hoc admin tasks, like preparing monthly fund performance reports, booking trades done by their manual trader (for their other non-quant funds), fixing the trader's Excel formulas, and helping non-tech staff run some Python scripts. I am even officially in their ""operation"" team now. This frankly is not what I expected.
* This firm has a weak tech foundation. They are just starting to do quant trading, so I understand that they don't have any existing infrastructure. What worries me more however is that they have no experienced developer neither; the only developer here has less than 1 YoE. I am afraid the project will quickly become a hell of technical debt.
* This firm is not very quantitative neither. The only real quant here has a straightly business background and received no formal math training beyond first year calculus (and no PhD ofc). He does have solid >5 year YoE as a quant trader, which is what really matters.
* The quant work I got to do is alright. The strategy they are developing sounds promising to me as a layman. If nothing else, at least I learned something about finance. I am unsure how this experience in a small fund will be valued when I enter the job market again.
* Overall, I think it all comes down to me not feeling enough growth opportunity. Quant research is one exciting opportunity that aligns with my technical interest, but I don't want to overly confine myself in that narrow space -- the quant industry is so competitive that I don't even know if I can get a next job. If I cannot stay in quant, the other option for me is a data scientist role in other sectors. But then, I am now spending 75% of my day doing work that adds zero transferable data skill to my profile.
* I am however aware that my worldview has become too academic after spending the extra years in school for my Master, so maybe all this is normal in the workspace and I am just being unrealistic.

The other role: Data scientist at a large tech company (\~3000 employees).

* The team lead there promised a salary higher than my current role (which is alright but not yet >100k), although I think it will be at best a 10% raise. If I take into account of bonus, probably I will get paid more overall if I can stay where I am for a full year.
* From what I heard, this company is building a new team to make use of the TB's of service usage data they have collected, mainly for marketing optimization. This team is more mature, with a functional tech stack and experienced data scientists and engineers. The team lead said this will be an opportunity for me to gain experience in being a ""full stack"" data scientist.
* I have a friend currently working in this company, and he said the job is just like what was on paper; I won't be wasting 75% of my time doing admin work like where I am.
* My main concern here is essentially the opposite of if I stay in my current role: I am afraid that taking this offer would mean the door to quant research is completely closed for me. Honestly, I think as a data scientist, going for quant related roles is the fastest way to reach my financial goals. And I wish to keep that door opened as much as possible.

I am a data scientist myself, working in a small team of other data scientists (<5). I'm soon reaching the 1-year cap, and I found out that code understandability/project onboarding (at least in my team) is a problem.

Most of my teammates are really good at math and statistics in general, but once I have to dive into one project, I just lose so much time trying to read their code and understand their explanations.

This can be hurtful, firstly because losing time is never a good thing, but also because it kind of makes me feel like an idiot to not be able to onboard a project without losing hours running and understanding all the code (and it can get very long if, on top of that, it's based on complex mathematics :p ). 

Of course, implementing better code practices such as commenting and better naming would be a good thing, but this idea is often met with the ""We don't have time to do that, we have worse problems and priorities"". 

  
So here's my question: Are there any other data scientists that have the same issues as me? How do you approach this problem?

datascience,115a37h,DS Problem: Hidden Business,__kVz__,1676706691.0,Discussion,2,0.63,"**CONTEX**

You work in a Retail Bank and as a Data Scientist you're called by the Marketing and Customer Value Management departments to work on a problem with a data-driven approach.

They figured out that many individual retail customers use their current account and debit/credit cards for business purpose (they are SME - Small Medium Enterprises - disguised as retail customers) and they want to find those 'hidden business' customers in order to reach them out with a cross-selling opportunity (e.g. open also a business account and keep your personal and business expenses separated, allowing lower taxation, etc.)

When you do some EDA on debit and credit card spendings you find out examples of retail customers with thousands of dollars per year spent on Facebook Ads, Google Ads, stores for business purchase only, etc. and you plan to use those features to train a model that identifies the 'hidden business' among the retail customer base.

**PROBLEM**

If your plan is to train a binary classifier you will soon figure out that the problem is that you have positive labels (customers with a business account and debit/credit card) but your negative labels are actually unknown: you don't know if they are hidden business or actual retail customers.

The standard metrics you will use to compute error and performance (AUC, precision, etc.) would be also flawed because you want to find out errors (e.g. customers with high scores of being a business but actual retail) not minimize it.

Also, you will end up doing training and scoring on the same dataset of the overall bank customer base.

>!SPOILER: Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PULearning) might be a solution but you have to make assumptions on the distribution of labeled/unabeled class!<",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/115a37h/ds_problem_hidden_business/

More specifically I'd like to assess the value provided by ML methods as part of a mixed methods approach to research with the aid of one or several case studies, with significant attention paid to methodological and epistemological concerns, engaging with the work of forerunners in the field such as Lakoff, Zadeh, Sartori and David Collier. As such, applying ML methods would be a significant portion of my research, but definitely a minority. Specific algorithms of interest would be determined by the case studies in question and what I'm capable of competently applying, but would likely centre around regression/classification and text analysis.

Once upon a time I had basic but fairly solid statistical skills along with more rudimentary technical skills in SQL, R and to a lesser extent Python, but these have unfortunately atrophied to the point of non existence after 3-4 years in a non-technical Data Science adjacent role. I therefore have a pretty steep hill to climb in terms of foundational skills before I could even submit my research proposal. I'm currently brushing up on algebra, calculus and statistical skills before pushing in to the unknown, most likely via the MITx Micromasters in Data, Development and Economics and/or in Data Science. However the sheer scope and complexity of the content I need to cover combined with working a full time job and the fact that a PhD position is by no means guaranteed at the end of it (I'm provisionally interested in Oxford or LSE) is pretty disheartening. As a result I'm interested in exploring low code / no code options such as KNIME and DataIku (I'd also welcome alternative suggestions) for data prep and model build to reduce the barrier to entry. I'd really value any input on whether these would be fit for purpose, specifically:

1. Will the choice of algorithms available fit my needs?
2. How low code are they exactly? In practice will I need to plug in significant amounts of my own code?
3. Do they provide sufficient guidance or hand holding to build models of sufficient quality for a top tier PhD program (keeping in mind that building the ML models would only be a relatively small portion of my research - I certainly wouldn't expect this to be the case if it was a purely quantitative thesis). To take some basic examples, would they flag if my variables were collinear, heteroskedastic etc

So a background of what I will be doing is that I will be helping new clients onboard to our company's SAaS products that is suitable on the client's business environment. Ultimately, I will be training them on our products but will implement the software based on their business needs. 

I have a background in project management and sales so even though the role seems to be a bit more technical, it's one skill I love to learn as I go through it. I can leverage my skills in project management and sales to get me up to speed on this new role. 

But on the other hand, I would want to incorporate some data analytics task to my job since I've always wanted to go to a more technically-focused career. I know that data analytics will have tasks such as data analysis and dashboard reporting, data processing, and perhaps a little bit of statistics. 

I really don't have a formal training on it though I know that the tasks I did in my previous jobs on my own initiative entailed having data analytics tasks. 

But what can you suggest what tools I use to be able to perform data analytics? Even basic excel will do as long as I get to understand the principles of data analytics and by then create a dashboard for my projects/accounts.

datascience,114dmwc,The Table Feature Transformation Library Release,jimliu741523,1676619058.0,Tooling,1,0.57,"Hi there,

I am a research data scientist, and excited to release a new feature engineering library, designed to help you streamline the process of machine learning even more than before. **Headjack is an open library which provides a ML features transformation based on self-supervised learning models**, similar to huggingface as a hub, but which currently focuses on exchanging features for tabular data models.

Compared to textual data, tabular data are different in that each data set has different column length and attributes, this means that it cannot be typed consistently unlike the token embedded in NLP tasks. Therefore, Headjack is different from NLP’s pre-trained model with single domain transformation, but by performing with two different domain transformations. **In other words, we can perform features transform between two domains without the same key value.** In addition, release the potential of data that is not typically used. For example, enhance the prediction of the Boston housing price task applied in the Titanic domain, or enhance the prediction of the customers churn task applied in the African traffic domain and so on.

datascience,114qfkp,I am worried about the future of working as a Data Scientist in industry,Slumi,1676650487.0,Discussion,0,0.47,"I once watched a video where someone argued that Michael Jordan had ruined basketball. As a person whose only notions of basketball come from Space Jam, this surprised me. Wasn't the guy the best out there? How could someone who's best in his field ruin it? After hearing the argument out though, I began to understand what the video was really getting at: to them, Michael Jordan had ruined the field BECAUSE he was so good. A sport that was once full of diverse personalities and strategies then turned into multiple teams trying to produce their own Michael Jordan copycat with copycat moves and copycat strategies.

I'm not well versed enough in basketball to know how right or wrong that guy was. But this concept that something could ruin an entire field simply by being too good stuck with me. And all these years later, I consistently think about it while doing my job as a Data Scientist. And the more GPT-X and ChatGPT advance, the more this concept haunts me.

I've been working in this field for 5 years. During the first 4 years, the job was exciting. Every new problem required extensive research on my part: looking for papers, datasets, implementations, implementing my own stuff, experimenting, comparing the results... That was the biggest part of my job. Yeah I still had to do some software engineering stuff here and there, but I felt like I had a well defined and specialized role at my company. Even in the NLP field, the variety of technologies I had to work with was a lot of fun: sometimes I used RNNs, sometimes embedding based similarity functions, sometimes more classic approaches, and then towards the end it was transformer after transformer, but at least I still had to finetune them myself.

Over the past few months and years, this has started to change, however. GPT-1 and 2 were promising, but were more of a proof of concept than anything realistically usable. But with GPT3's and ChatGPT's latest performance, it feels like NLP is becoming more and more standardized. I wouldn't call it a solved field, far from it. But, sadly, unless you work for a big tech company,  I think the days of exploratory research-type work in the NLP field are over.

Even in academia, the latest NLP papers I've seen come out of prestigious universities went from actual engineering/mathematical advances to ""Look, if you ""engineer"" the prompt like this, it works better sometimes!""

And now, with the exploding popularity of ChatGPT, any random lambda would come to the conclusion that if you need to use AI, ChatGPT is the answer.

Now, some of you may already be thinking ""but hold on, with my finetuned transformer I get a 1% increase in accuracy over out-of-the-box GPT-3!"". The thing is: even if you can, it doesn't really matter. I really doubt the sales team of your company is gonna pay much attention to your pleas to give you 6 months to work on a product rather than 6 minutes. Because yes, that's the increase in productivity we're dealing with: What took me months a few years ago only takes minutes now. The range of problems I can apply NLP too has also increased, as out-of-the-box GPT-3 works well enough not to require a dataset for more ""general"" tasks. And the results are either comparable or even better.

In the span of a year, NLP went from my favorite ML field to one I never see myself working in again if given the choice. And while a lot of non NLP fields are, for now, untouched by the exploding popularity of the GPT family, I'm afraid that what happened to the NLP field will be replicated in other fields, and that in a few years, only super specialized issues won't have a solution somewhere in the form of a ridiculously big model accessible via an API key provided by a big tech company. And even if GPT3 was open source, the sheer size of it makes it close to impossible to realistically train for anything less than the biggest of tech companies out there. Even finetuning it would be a challenge.

I'm not saying the job of data scientist will disappear, in fact, I'd say it will be asked more than ever since boomers who don't understand what the title actually implies will want some in their company. But we won't be doing nearly as much actual data sciency stuff as we did in the past. Instead we'll have to become even bigger software engineer/data analyst/DevOps/project manager hybrids than we already were. The only exception is for people who either work in big tech companies or on very specialized problems that require an in-house model.

It's not that much of a problem for people who like the roles I listed above. But for people like me, whose enjoyment came out of the exploratory side of the job, I believe the future to be bleak.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/114qfkp/i_am_worried_about_the_future_of_working_as_a/

datascience,113lqe4,Open-source framework to build Web Apps in Jupyter Notebook with Python only,pplonski,1676535900.0,Projects,18,0.88,"Hi there,

## Share notebook with non-technical users (managers)

Sharing results from Jupyter Notebook might be a pain:

- you can't share notebook to stakeholders because they don't speak Python, cant run notebook by their own,

- you need to copy-paste charts into PowerPoint presentation,

- you need to rewrite your results to some web framework to make your results interactive.


Jupyter project offers a Voila as a solution for running notebooks as web apps. I found Voila a difficult to use, especially ipywidgets.

## Mercury 

I started to work on my own open-source framework for running notebooks as web apps. Mercury allows you to add interactive widgets in Python notebooks, so you can share notebooks as web applications. It offers a set of widgets with simple re-execution of cells.

GitHub repository: [github.com/mljar/mercury](https://github.com/mljar/mercury)

Documentation: [RunMercury.com](https://RunMercury.com)

## What you can build

You can use Mercury Widgets to create:

- [web apps](https://runmercury.com/tutorials/web-app-python-jupyter-notebook/), reports, dashboards,

- [presentations](https://runmercury.com/tutorials/presentation-python-jupyter-notebook/) - use widgets to interact with slides, slides are recomputed during the slideshow

- [websites](https://runmercury.com/tutorials/website-python-jupyter-notebook/) - share notebook as static HTML (with code hidden), 

## Features

Unique features that make Mercury different than Voila or Streamlit

- simple re-execution of cells after widget update,

- all input widgets are displayed in the sidebar, your app layout is ready,

- authentication to control access to notebooks (coming soon),

- easy file upload and download in notebook,

- export result to PDF or HTML with button click.


## Future plans

I would like to provide a cloud service for notebook deployment. You will upload notebook and it will be available as web app/website.

datascience,113ndfy,From Academia to Data Science: How to efficiently,KaitiKolesidou,1676542723.0,Career,8,0.73,"**Long story short:** I have a PhD in Mathematics and at the moment, I'm working as a Postdoc. However, I am seriously thinking of joining the data science club due to its increasing popularity as well as its broad spectrum of career options. My question as the title suggests is how to achieve that in the most optimal way for my personal case.

&#x200B;

**A few more details about my background:** My research interests lie in the field of Partial Differential Equations and Analysis. This in particular implies that I am not that familiar with Probability&Stats. I did have some courses in my bachelor but that's it. I am definitely more comfortable with multivariable calculus and linear algebra for instance. Regarding programming, I know python and I have worked with libraries like numpy, pandas and matplotlib in the past. I do not know any SQL nor Machine Learning yet. I do enjoy anything that involves programming so far.

&#x200B;

**My initial plan:** In the beginning, I thought (maybe a bit naively) to just start learning the most essential skills needed by myself and after a point start doing some projects on my own. To be honest, I would prefer better to follow an online degree or something similar but I am certainly on a budget here. So, instead I downloaded some books and saved some tutorials in YouTube for later use. However, this path of self-education feels just not right. I am continuously contemplating if I chose the appropriate books/sources, plus I am not sure which exact project I should aim to solve later.

&#x200B;

**Current plan:** A few days ago, I came across with this program: [https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) (definitely not an ad here). It has plenty of prerequisites which only half of them I already know. It does offer the option of building several projects, although I am not sure if they cover a lot of significant data science topics. A huge drawback for me is the price, as I mentioned I 'm on a budget here.  However, I started thinking that as long as I become familiar with all the prerequisites, maybe following this program is a more efficient (and cheaper compared to other degrees) way to transition into data science.

&#x200B;

**Questions:**

1. Is this degree actually worth it or will I waste my money? Any other (more useful) suggestion is welcome.
2. To the experienced ones out there: given my situation, *what would be the most optimal way to make such a transition into data science?*  To be honest, I would prefer the parts of data science that involve more programming but as I am complete new to this huge field, I have no clue if such parts exist, which are exactly and if my academic qualifications would matter (salary-wise) at all there.
